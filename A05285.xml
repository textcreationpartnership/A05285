            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Even those <hi>men of bloods,</hi> the Prelacie, as we have proved, whose dignitie (as the late King hath it in the preface of his Basilicon) <hi>smelleth vildlie of Popelike pride;</hi> yea they are a main part of him; <hi>bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.</hi> Against this Hierarchie we do not commence, but renew our suite, for the recovery of the <hi>Keyes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>veyle</hi> of his <hi>spouse:</hi> In the prosecution whereoff we intreat the help of all that love the Lord: First agree with God, by reforming at home; and then looke upon them, as they are clearly convinced, to be enemies to God, and the State; and so <hi>hate them with a perfect hatred; be not ashamed of Christ and his Word;</hi> that is, of standing for the Priviledges of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no, not among an <hi>adulterous &amp; sinfull generation;</hi> that is, when Christ <hi>enemies</hi> are in their <hi>ruff,</hi> left Christ be ashamed of you. As for their swelling pride, feare it not. There are <hi>more with vs, then against vs:</hi> yea it is enough, that the <hi>Lord of Hostes</hi> is against them.</p>
            <p>We may say truely of them, as an ancient said of the Prelates of his time: <hi>Omnibus terrori, amantur à nullo:</hi> they are a terror to all, and loved by none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by such as stand too nigh them in a contiguitie of profitt, Poperie, or Prophanes; these indeed cannot see; because they will not see.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:8853:7"/>
            <p>As for their traditions, whereby they support them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they are branches of the same root, condemned by the Word, Councils, Fathers; by all ancient, and modern, Orthodox writers: yea, and by the Positions of the Papists. But it is enough, (as D. Whittaker ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth): <hi>quod à Christo damnantur:</hi>

When a bodye politique is runne all into one festered sore of sin &amp; one benumming bruise of <hi>iudgment,</hi> then the universall and painefull distemper taketh awaye the discerning facultie of the <hi>Master sore</hi> that hath bred and fed all the rest, which indeede must eyther be sought out and removed,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Therefore L. Bishops, Archbishops &amp;c. are of no use in Gods Church.</p>
                  <p>The learned have used the same argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pope, the Church of God being builte up and perfited without him, therfore hee should not bee.</p>
                  <p>The argument is everie way as good against these Bishops and everie such Officer in Gods house, with out the which his house is compleat, as against the Pope, for it cannot be said of those Bishops as our Lord said of the Asse:<note place="margin">

                  <p>The same argument holds against the Ceremonies, yea as a knob, a wen, or any superfluous bonch of flesh, being no mēber doth not onely overburthen the body, but also disfigureth the feature, yea killeth the body at length except it be cut; so these Bishops be the knobs &amp; wens and bunchie popish flesh which beareth down, deformeth &amp; deadeth the bodie of the Church, that ther is no cure (as we conceive) but cutting off: If any object that there be necessarie Officers in Gods house, as Deacons and Elders, which are not named in that forequoted place of the Ephesians, it may be easilie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that the Apostle there onelie intends to make a perfect enumeration of such as labour in the word, for the perfecting of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Further if men may ad ministeries to those whom God hath appointed, then may they take away such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries as God hath appointed, for both of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to one and the self-same authoritie.</p>
                  <p>But men may not take away such ministeries as God hath appointed. Therefore they must not adde such as he hath not appointed.</p>
                  <p>As we have hitherto proved in general the calling of the Bishops to be unlawfull, so we come now to prove directlie their calling and their dependancies to be Antichristian.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. In the point of subscription urged. <hi>Canon. 36.37.</hi> It is to be seene what heavy things are pressed upon the Conscience of every one that entreth upon any ministeriall function, namely <hi>That nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in the publique leiturgie, the booke of ordination, or the Articles of Religion in number. 39.</hi> Is contrary to the word of God. Yea that every thing contayned in every one of the aforesaid Articles, is agreeable to the word of God. And this he must doe, adding every expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that may avoyd ambiguitie. And in like manner they must subscribe to the two bookes of <hi>Homilies.</hi> Now what grosse, absurd (if wee say not) blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vntruthes all theis <hi>5</hi> bookes are stuffed with, wee neede not to demonstrate, since by a judicious and true inquiry they are made more then manifest. Especially the service booke; which they cannot deny to be raked out of three Romishe channells; Namely the <hi>Briviary</hi> out of which the common prayers are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, out of the <hi>Rituall or booke of Rites</hi> the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, buryall, matrimony, visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sicke are taken. And out of the <hi>Masse booke</hi> are the consecration of the Lords supper, Collects, Gospells and Epistles. As for the booke of Ordination of Arch-bishops, Bishops, Ministers &amp;c. it is out of the <hi>Romane Pontificall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:8853:23"/>
                  <p>Now from this prescript forme of Leiturgie, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister must not go a jote, nor use any other in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed service: Witnesse <hi>Canon.</hi> 38. which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed according to the mynde of the <hi>Prince,</hi> nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law. It is a wonder to see, what adding, changing, and taking away, is in that Leiturgie. To which <hi>English Masse</hi> (for so his late Majestie called it) it is not the intent of the law, that the Ministers should subscribe, witnes that statute. 1. <hi>Eli. Cap.</hi> 2. bynding them to use such prayers and order of administration of the Sacraments, as are contained in that booke, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised by Parliament in the 5. and 6. yeares of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> 6. with the alteration or addition of some les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and <hi>none other or otherwise.</hi> Againe the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no subscription, but barely to the Articles of Religion; which onely <hi>concerne the confession of true Christian faith, and the doctrine of the Sacraments,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the very words of the <hi>Satute</hi> 13. <hi>Eli. Cap.</hi> 12. which Statute is not yet abrogated nor contradicted. So that to the matter of Ceremony and of Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, subscription is not by the law required. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is well knowne to judicious men now living, that it was not her Maj<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. mynd, nor the meaning of the law to presse these things upon the consciences of her truly professing subj<seg rend="sup">s</seg>; But the intent was only to bring Papists and Popishly affected to a Church conformitie, condiscending to retayne some Popish passages, till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation might be more fully made. Vpon which grounds the Honourable Court of Parliament would never have any bound to it, seeing the things not only controverted, but also reiected by whole reformed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8853:23"/> Churches. But we see the Prelats require subscription to all the aforesaid books; Yea least vexation enough should be wanting to Gods people they have hatched out of their own brains, <hi>An hundred &amp; fiftie laws,</hi> called <hi>the Canons,</hi> as we may thinke in apishe immitation of the Psalmes of David, whereunto though they exact not subscription, yet they tye men strictly, and afflict them greivously, both in purse &amp; person for not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: which is a malapert countermanding of his Majesties laws, and a haynous oppression of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,<note place="margin">15. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19.</note> witnesse that <hi>Statute of Henry the 8. forbidding any man to make or exercise laws or Church orders, repugnant to the laws of the Realme.</hi> But many of those Canons and visitation Articles (to which they force men to sweare) are repugnant to the laws. By this your Honours do see and very well know that the laws are made of none effect (and that to the best of his Majesties subjects) which may yet be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced by divers particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

But ministers are thrust from their benefices by the bare and peremptorie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Bishops. The iniquitie &amp; crueltie of this their course was laid to heart by the States in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament Anno. 1610. who inacted against it in effect as followeth; <hi>where the Canons would charge body goods and Lands of the subiect, that charge shall be of no force, except it were confirmed by act of Parliament.</hi> 4. Where by the law of the Land no free man should (but upon lawfull proceeding and just ground) be imprisoned: the Prelats against the laws and libertie of the State, and Priviledge of the Subject, erect prisons, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt men thereto at their pleasure, if they will not breake the Laws. As for instance in taking of the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> which is (as shall be shewed) against all laws of Heaven and Earth. This tricke of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as <hi>Choppinus</hi> saith) was taken up by <hi>Pope Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the second,<note place="margin">De sacr.

                  <p>This tyranny rather then law had its first originall in England (as the lawes record, and learned of the land witnesse) from that statute 2, <hi>Henry 4. Cap. 15.</hi> whereby authority was given to the prelates and their Ordinaries to imprison and fyne the subjects and to presse the lawlesse oath upon them.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8853:24"/> in the record, <hi>petitio cleri contra haereticos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ex Rotul. Parliamenti Anno <hi>2.</hi> Henr. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> and was passed as is shewed without the consent of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, witnesse the record of the statute, yea our learned in discovering the iniquity and bloudthirsty cruelty of this law tell us, that it wanted not onely the consent of the commons, but they wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repined at it. But as evill means must ever est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablish an evil purchase, the King was forced by their importunity to lay the necks of his best subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the feet of the blouddie beast, of which more hereafter. But the state at length laying to heart the abundance of christian blood that had been shed by this <hi>blooddie law</hi> (for so it is called) and observing the judgment of God that had ensued on this bloodshed upon the State, (as afterward shall be made plain) with vnanimous and full consent made voyd and revoked that statute of imprisoning and the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> leaving not the least impression of any such power to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> because it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of God, the Honour of the King, the law of the Land, the nature of Ecclesiasticke jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the right of the Subject.</p>
                  <p>It is true that in the 1. and 2. of Philip and Marie, a statute was framed according to that formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked statute of Henry. 4. But first it doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Church had no power of imprisoning but onely the power of the keyes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They inacted this that by fiery and bloody courses they might supplant the Gospel, whereof the people being mindfull and exceeding sensible in that Parliament of the 1. Elizabeth requested the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8853:25"/> state to repeale, and make voyd that statute of Henr. 4. concerning imprisoning, and <hi>the selfe-accusing oath,</hi> which the state did grant and established in expresse words before the annexing of the right of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke jurisdiction to the Crowne, <hi>repealing, making utterlie void, and of none effect all and every branche, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, clauses and sentences in the said statute, from the last day of that Parliament.</hi> So that we see the imprisoning, fineing, and pressing of the oath by the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, hangeth not onely upon that bloudy act for defence of Popery, repealed by the statute laws of the Land, but is also directly against that very act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or statute from which their commission is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as shall be more clearely demonstrated in an other place. But this sufficiently sheweth how egregiouslie they abuse the Kings authoritie, and wrong the subject notwithstanding of all this.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder that <hi>B. Whitgift</hi> will side with <hi>Pighi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> against <hi>Marcilius Patavinus</hi> (in fetching a ground from <hi>Peters</hi> killing of <hi>Ananias</hi> &amp; <hi>Saphyra</hi>) for their imprisoning of men; might they not aswell warrant the killing of them, for they kill many of them: For that act of <hi>Peters</hi> was not done (as the learned answer well) by an ordinary power, but by that extraordinary power,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.28.</note> which the Apostle calleth <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">5. And lastly, they inforce the Lawes of the Land that are for the subject, against the very best subjects, namely, such as gather themselves together, to humble their soules for the sinnes of the times, for the safetie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8853:25"/> of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the deliverance of the common weale. Against such it is most true, <hi>there is no Law.</hi> But these men will either <hi>have one or make one against them,</hi> namely, they must be charged with <hi>Conventicles,</hi> where as they are neither such people as are meant in the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; nor doth that law intend <hi>to them</hi> any molestation; but rather preservation, aswell as the preservation of the Prince and State from the dangerous conventions and riotous assemblyes of plotting Papists. If the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the <hi>Law depend upon the mynde of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> (as indeed it doth) with what faces can men turne the law against the innocent for the guiltie? May not &amp; doe not the Papists meete &amp; plott mischeefe against the Church and State, without the Tenth part of this molestation? Yes it is too too true, but it is no new thing for them, and the Prelats to <hi>Lapp it up:</hi> Yet is it not a wonder, why they should hate and oppose so much that which is the preservation of the Church &amp; State.

                  <p>How can the libertie of a loyall subject, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just restraint of the same consist together? How can the disclayming of Soveraigne power, and the imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and obeying of it stand together? How can the subscription to the Articles of Religion (which onely concerne the true Christian Faith and Doctrine of the Sacraments) and the subscription to books, contayning many things contrary to the word of God (as a number of Popish Rites and mens devises) consist together? As unnaturall heate consumeth the inbred or naturall heate and radicall moisture of the bodie; So the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Laws of the Prelats, eate up and consume the power of the Lawes of the Land. Yea their Laws are not onely worse then the Canon Laws (which are badd enough) but worse then the laws and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the very worst times of our Nation under the high command of Popery, which will appeare by the comparing of the Canons of that Counsell of Oxford houlden by <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Achb. of Cant. 280. yeares agoe. There it was decreed, that none should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate

There also it was decreed, <hi>ne presument judices esse &amp; actores, That none should take upon them to be judges, actors, and accusers.</hi> But this they doe, when the judge dealeth <hi>ex officio.</hi> We could instance in many other of the like nature, but a tast is enough: yea doe they not exceede the height of Popery in this, that there, an Appeale was allowed to every man, to that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame courte of the man of sinne. But they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and hinder the just Appeale of the Kings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to a higher Courte, without exception. And so much for this point.</p>

                  <p>Can a man serve two Masters or obey two Lords of opposite commands? As the Heavens contayne no Sunnes but one; nor a Kingdom no Kings but one: So a people cannot obey any Laws, but such as are at one and unitie with themselves. If the Prelats practise,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8853:27"/> and Injunctions extort or enjoyne one thing, and the laws of the Land, and the good of the King require another thing opposite to that, who can obey both? Yea who can obey the Prelats, but he maketh himself <hi>a Transgressor to the King and the Laws;</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, it is straightly forbidden by the laws of the Land (especially by that oath of allegeance) whereunto all the Kings subjects are sworne; either implicitlie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitlie) <hi>That no forraigne power, authoritie or jurisdiction (and more particularly of the Pope of Rome) shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,</hi>

As for the chāge of supremacie, it can not make a body that is naught in it selfe, and cōtinuing the same to be good. As for their writings and Sermons against the Pope and his usurped power, it may be answered, <hi>quid verba audiam, cum facta vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deam?</hi> Their words crosse their actions. Yea, it is to be feared, that the Popes supremacie, if it could be as gainefull, would please manie of their palats better then the Kings.

                  <p>Further it is inacted (as we haue shewed by act of Parliament) <hi>That all the Prelates writts for exercise of their jurisdiction should runne</hi> (as hath bene shewed) <hi>not in their own names and with their own seales,</hi>

                     <hi>but in the Kings name and under the Kings seale.</hi> But they in their owne names, and with their owne seales signe cite, attach, and imprison, laying the burthen of their tirannie upon the King: if at anie time they seeme to be affected with the miseries of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereof they are the onelie cause. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand with the clemencie of a roiall heart to vexe or imprison his loiall subjects for serving of the same God whom he serveth, and for denying obedience to the verie things that are contrarie to Gods lawes, the soveraigne power of the King and laws of the land. As it is then against all law, reason and equitie, that the subjects are thus vexed and wronged; so the serving of such writts and warrants by pursuivants, and the assistance by constables and others, is injurie to the subject, violence to the lawes, and an effront to the King. For the clearing whereof, <hi>Simsons Case</hi> is upon record, who was cleared by the law, because the Constable under the prelates warrant, was adjudged by law to be <hi>out of his place</hi> but of this more hereafter. And thus the point is cleared, that yealding obedience to such writts or warrants consisteth not with obedience to the King and his lawes.</p>
                  <p>It is further cleared by being flatlie opposite to the Kings prerogative,<note place="margin">25. <hi>Henr.</hi> 8.</note> that anie Courts should bee kept or jurisdiction exercised in his realm but in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8853:28"/> Kings name, and by an especiall grant. Instance the Iudges Commissions of <hi>Oier and Terminer,</hi> and so of the rest: but the Bishops and their officers hold their Courts and exercise their jurisdictions not in the Kings name, nor by anie speciall grant, but in their owne name intruding upon his Majesties prerogative roiall, inforcing Churchwardens and Sidemen to serve as instruments against the same.</p>
                  <p>Further no subject can both obay the Kings laws: and the Prelats Courts: because they judge, or exercise jurisdiction by deputies as Chancellours Officials, Arcdeacons. This is first an intrenching upon the Kings prerogative: for none but the King can delegate or substitute a judge in his place especiallie if the place of judicature be of a high nature (as the Prelats is, if it were right) but these Prelats committ their counterfeit <hi>Keyes</hi> often to such <hi>Cerberean Porters:</hi> as shutt the gates upon Christs Freinds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine his foes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This deputation is against the nature of an office of <hi>confidence or trust</hi> (as the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> speaks verie learnedlie to this point) as it is <hi>personally inherent,</hi> so it must be personally discharged, &amp; not transported to an other, as he instanceth in the office of the <hi>Lord Chancell. of England,</hi> or any other judge: who never made nor can make a deputie, except they have some speciall clause, contained in their original graunt; and then also it is verie doubtfull (saith he) that this is so, it is cleare from the statute of Henr. 8.<note place="margin">26. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> by which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Archbishop cannot take to himself a <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragane</hi> or assistant Bishop (much lesse can he depute an

As for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of resisting this usurped power there is none <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> howsoever <hi>these men of usurpation</hi> make it their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8853:29"/> trade to afflict the Kings subjects <hi>de facto;</hi> but the laws which are the <hi>Priviledge of the subjects, the life of the Land,</hi> and true obedience to the King, should be more precious to a true harted subject, then liberty or life it self; and what a man would doe for the defence of his life, he should doe in the defence of these. For the lawfullnesse of this defence, we produce both the Laws of the Land, and the Counsell of the learned according to the Laws. For the former, if the lawes inacted &amp; so often confirmed, do inhibitt all summons, assaults, attaching of the body, imprisoning or fineing but by due course of the law of the Land, then all the Prelats courses in the above-said particulars, may and must be resisted <hi>quoad posse</hi> (because they are not legall, but against the <hi>great Charter</hi>) but the former is true, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter. For further proofe hereof, we commend unto your Honours to review these noble acts amōgst many other decreed by that high Court of Parliament Anno 1610. For this very particular as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whereas the temporall sword was never in the Prelats power till the</hi> 2. <hi>of Henr. 4. and then usurped by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of the commons (for say, they were truely Ecclesiasticall,) yet it is against the Lawes of God and of the Land, that they should meddle with civill jurisdiction, therefore is an act past against it, and the oath</hi> ex officio <hi>brought in at the same time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That statute 1. <hi>Elizab. c. 1. giving power to the Queen to constitute and make a Commission in causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall is found inconvenient,</hi> because abusing that

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Whereas by vertue of the statute power, onely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall is graunted; yet by Letters-Patents from the King, unsoundly grounded on the words of the statute, they fine, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison &amp;c. which is a great grief, and a wrong to the subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Where upon deprivation by the ordinarie jurisdiction an appeale lyeth; the words of the commission exclude it. For here is no traverse, nor writt of error after judgment.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>These evills and greivances were seriously pondered by that Honourable assembly, and provided against by the foresaide acts, but the <hi>Remora-Prelats</hi> &amp; <hi>Logs</hi> of their laying, so blocked up the way, that the said acts could not passe: and rather then they would suffer the plague-soare of their oppressing pride to be burst by the maturating cataplasmes of <hi>wholesom laws,</hi> they made a shift to break the King and state into peeces, as they did indeed, to the no small griefe of all good subjects, to the vexation (yea allmost killing) of the <hi>two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> the indemnifying &amp; dishonouring of the state;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now come we to the latter peece of evidence in the behalf of this lawfull resistance, namely, the case avouched under the hand of learned counsell, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in his owne words:
<floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <p>THe case is, vvhether the high commission of the North, have povver to send a pursuivant to arrest the bodie of any man, and hovv farreforth the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe or other of his Majesties Officers be bound to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them, and vvhether each severall Bishop having a severall commission, may (calling to him <hi>3.</hi> or moe commissioners) execute the commission.</p>
                           <p>This learning is not to be rubd upon too boldlie, yet in my opinion the high commission hath not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient vvarrant to send a pursuivant to arrest, because the statute of Magna Charta <hi>5. 30.

                  <p>You see how in clearing of this case the smell of <hi>a goat</hi> maketh this honest coūseller somwhat agueish, but such is his ingenuity, &amp; <hi>truth is so stronge</hi> that the case in our conceit is well cleared.</p>
                  <p>To proceede the people also (being inforced to wait upon them) become accessarie to their sinne of disobedience. If that clause of the statute be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, where <hi>the King graunteth them authority in as ample manner as they had in the Popes time:</hi> it may be answered in the first place; that that proclaimeth to the world, their <hi>being</hi> to be <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and their power to be forreigne; for they remaine the same for matter and forme, that they did before; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie onely changed. 2. Besides that generall; <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> it is a lawe case, that <hi>generall words</hi> cannot carry away any part of the right of the Crowne: and such are these words, without any <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall warrant</hi> to leade them. 3. The grant is onely to rule over their <hi>inferiour brethren</hi> (meaning the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrye.</hi>) Which rule (by the way) is directly against Gods statuts; howsoever with the laitie (as they call them) by this statute they have nothing to doe. It was truly averred by a Prime judge of the Land, that that, which <hi>binds all, should be assented to of all,</hi> or by the representative body of all, but what private men do the Prelats call to their convocation howse? or what voyce or assistance have they to or in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations or Canons of the Prelats?</p>
                  <p>The Prelacie, taking this to consideration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a statute 1. Edw. 6. enabling them (as they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8853:31"/> conceive) to keep their Courts &amp; exercise jurisdiction; But first, that was to be done in the <hi>Kings name,</hi> and not in their owne.</p>
                  <p>Further, all such jurisdiction, is annexed to the Crowne 1. Eliz. 1. forbidding all exercise of spirituall power and jurisdiction, without a <hi>speciall warrant</hi> from the Crown, and all that doe the contrary, are declared to be intruders.</p>
                  <p>The last instance (though we might abound) is from the oathes urged by the Prelats, especially that oath <hi>ex officio.</hi> By the law of the Land, they are forbidden to put any to their oath,<note place="margin">Crompton. <hi>182.</hi> Fitz. de natura brev. p. <hi>141.</hi> Regist.

                  <p>As to the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> whereby both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and people are vexed and insnared, what can be said, that hath not been said against it? <hi>Heaven and Earth is against it;</hi> It is against the law of God; the law of the nature; the common law; the Canon law, Counsells, and imperiall statuts. Though the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, and the evills ensuing are sufficientlie knowne to your Honours, and to all of understanding; yet we make bold (under favour) to detect the evills of it, for our owne and others information.</p>

Neyther can he sweare <hi>in righteousnes,</hi> because he is forced to betray others; which rather <hi>then an honest man should doe</hi> (as a Father wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth) <hi>he should loose his life.</hi>

                  <p>Further, the <hi>matter</hi> is not of <hi>waight,</hi> nor of <hi>qualitie</hi> (for it should be <hi>Criminall;</hi>) not of necessitie (for it may be otherwise cleared;) nor maketh this oath the end <hi>of strife;</hi> and therefore it cannot be taken <hi>in judgmēt</hi> &amp;c. A worthy gentlmā being pressed with an oath against himself in an other case, made answer by a pretty dilemma; <hi>if the thing supposed to be done, be a sinne, then must I not accuse my selfe; and if it be no sinne there is no ground of an oath.</hi>

                  <p>In the times of the 7. Kings of the Saxons, which be but the beginings of higher attempts: For when Egbert had made of all the foresaid kingdoms, one intire Monarchie, the Lord stirred up the Danes a firey, barbarous and cruell nation (after some attempts) to seaze upō the kingdom which they brought to such a slaverie, as the like was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read off: and what was the cause why God gaue them up to such a fearfull judgment? the learned tell us <hi>for their idolatrie, and superstition, hatched and increased by the swelling prelates, whence issued all manner of profanesse,</hi> yet in both these they came short of ours, to shutte up this centurie: may your Honours be pleased to observe what a pickle this clergie had put the State into, by that oration of king <hi>Edgar</hi> whom <hi>Dunstane</hi> that notorious jugler and sorcerer by his lying dreames, and fained mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles seduced mightily, to the hurt of him and his subjects.</p>
                  <p>Now let us take a scantling of the last Centurie of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> from <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour to our times; wherein for further demonstration of our propounded greivance, we can shew them to bee the fewell, fire, and bellowes, of all our greatest evills.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the Conquest. As the <hi>Idolatrie and Superstition</hi> (as hath bene shewed) of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors was the cause why God gave-up this nation to the Danish cruelty, so histories witnesse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that vision, of king Edward a litle before his death, how the idlenes, avarice, dissolute life, and overlording of the clergie (whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8853:35"/> all impietie, loosnesse, and iniquitie of the laity) were the verie cause why God gaue the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up to the intollerable tyrannie of the Normans, whereby lawes, liberties, houses of Nobility, and all states and conditions were either raced, or inslaved; and if <hi>a body</hi> may be known by the head, let the practise of <hi>Stigandus</hi> and the men of his <hi>Sea</hi> speak in the first place for all, who being exceeding rich, and extreamly greedy <hi>invaded</hi> (as it is written) <hi>the Sea of Canterburie by Simonie,</hi> being both <hi>B. of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> and <hi>Abbot</hi> of an other place: but from him to <hi>Langfrank that conquering Prelate,</hi> for as a learned <hi>Antiquarie</hi> saith wittily, and truly, <hi>He thought it all reason, that he should make a Conquest of the English clergy as his Master had made a conquest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His successor <hi>Anselme,</hi> confirming that Doctrine of <hi>Devills,</hi> against Ministers mariage, affronted the King to his face, threatening to excommunicate him in his owne quarrell, yea for all the Kings witt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, he made him seeke all the corners of his saddle and iustled him from his right, for which feates of activitie, the Pope honoured him highly, in giving him to sitt at his right foote, with this <hi>Encomie, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludamus hunc in orbe nostro, tanquam alterius orbis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam; Let us inclose this man within our owne spheare, as the Pope of an other World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What dissention, war, and bloodshed overflowed the Land in the time of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> who invaded the Crowne contrary to his oath, given to Maude the Empresse daughter to King Henr. 1. and his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8853:36"/> owne Cousin, all this was from the advise of William Corveil, Archbishop of Canterbury, being backed by the Pope, the Father of such Children, this stickeling Prelate contrary to his faith given to the said Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, stole away the peoples hearts, from their Native Soveraigne, whence issued so much evill of sinne and judgment, as perjury, rapine, bloodshed, oppression, as made the Land <hi>a Map of misery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did not <hi>Thurstane</hi> Archb. work the King a great deal of mischeife &amp; trouble, getting the Pope to threaten the King with excommunication, if he were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sea of Yorke upon his owne termes. And so entered, maugre the Kings resolution.</p>
                  <p>What a deale to doe made that proud Popeling <hi>Beckett</hi> to King Henry the second, and all the state; His cause (as his owne favorites affirme) being no better then patrocinie of murtherers, and other vile male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors of the Clergie, whom he would not suffer (contrary to his owne edict and oath) to be tryed by the Laws of the Land, having committed (as it is recorded) in one yeare a 100. severall murthers upon the Kings subiects. To such as were arraigned of them, he tooke upon him to be <hi>asylum,</hi> or sanctuary, but as he brought himself unto diserved destruction (though the form of his executiō is not to be approved) so his pride and rebellion was <hi>transubstantiated</hi> by the Pope, (who can make every thing of any thing) unto an Idolatrous and blasphemous <hi>saint-ship.</hi> This plagued the Land worse then all the rest, for as it is treason against a King to entertayne his rebell under the name of an Honourable and Lawfull subject, so it is high treason
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8853:36"/> against God, to make an Idoll of a Trayter, (as <hi>Beckett</hi> was) whose name of blasphemy so resounded every where, (as one saith well) <hi>that the name of Christ was quite forgotten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come we now to William B. of <hi>Ely</hi> (the Popes Legate and Vicar, first Chancellour of England, and then Viceroy in King Richards absence) what port he kept, what tyranny he exercised over all the Kings subiects, not forbearing the Kings owne brethren, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories make plain, in so much as one saith well, <hi>that the Laitie found him more then a King, and the Clergie more then a Pope.</hi> As he devoured all where he came with his great pompous traine (no fewer then a 1000. or 1600: horse) so he had undone the State, if he had not been taken off.</p>
                  <p>Let Steven Langton take the next place, whom the Pope made choice of, <hi>ut virum strenuum</hi> (as one saith) <hi>such a one as would beard Kings, rob Churches, and keep the people in slaverie,</hi> whose entrance being resisted by King Iohn, both he and his realm were interdicted by the Pope, who enarmed the French King, with the pardon of all his sinnes, and the Crowne of England for his paines, if he would invade him in this strait.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the Popes lymbes (like traytors as they were) sided with the French King; the Nobilitie shrunke, and the commons wavered, not knowing what to do, whereupon the King (notwithstanding his Princely and magnanimious parts) was so mated with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8853:37"/> that miscreant and danted, partly with the feare of forraigne and domesticke foes, and partly with the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of his fainting adherents, that he was forced to vassal himself, and his Kingdom at the Popes foote, wherein though the King shewed his weakenes, yet his heavy and many burdens plead hard for his excuse. And as we cannot read the story without much pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that worthy, (though unhappy Prince) so we can not but abhorre these treacherous Prelats, and blame exceedingly the inconstancie and disloyaltie of his subjects. Hence be pleased to observe (right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) <hi>what an evill thing it is for subjects through their pusillanimitie to leave their Soveraigne in the hands of wickednes,</hi> it maketh them often doe what they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would nor should.</p>
                  <p>This instance of this abused and murthered King is the rather to be thought on, by reason of the French Kings resolution against the State, who unadvisedly brought him in, he resolved to destroy all the nobilitie and their howses that had taken part with him against their native Soveraigne, besides the other tyrannyes, which the French would have practised, so that we should take notice how that one brand out of the <hi>Popes Chimney</hi> had not onely sett on fire, but had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most consumed the Kingdom to ashes, if the Lord had not by an extraordinary discovery from a French <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> on his death bed, delivered the Nation.</p>
                  <p>To come to Henry the thirds time, wherein that <hi>bloody Bishop</hi> (for so the story calleth him) <hi>Peter</hi> of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, set himself, with one <hi>Peter Rivalis,</hi> the Kings
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8853:37"/> Minion, to plott the overthrowe of the best deserve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing states-men, yea of the King and state it self, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance his practise against the life and honour of that well deserveing worthy <hi>Hubert,</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> and Lord cheife Iustice of England, <hi>the very sword and safeguard of his Prince,</hi> (as one calleth him) both against for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne and domesticke foes, yet because he could not indure the pride &amp; treachery of the Prelats by false &amp; forged criminations, they brought him under the Kings displeasure. By reason whereof he suffered many grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous things, and was often in danger of his life, but the good hand of God was with him in extraordinary deliverances. And at last (being rid out of the way into Wales) that the Prelats might the more freely worke, they and others their Confederates, put the King upon such evill courses, as had almost undone himself, and the State of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the aforesaid Peter of Winchester, one Roger Bacon moved a pretty question to the King, <hi>What things doe Sea-men most feare? Stormes and quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi> (said the King) <hi>or such like. No</hi> (saith Bacon) <hi>but Petrus de Rupibus, for they are the Rockes indeed that make Ship-wracke of the state.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> the first also and his government, wanted not his share of hard measure from the Prelats, for (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that universall obedience which Robert Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelsey Archb. of Cant. yealded to the Popes Edict, against contribution to the King in his Warres) he stood out with the King upon his owne termes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, perswading absolute obedience to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8853:38"/> Pope, and not to the King. Also after much intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable tyranny exercised over the Kings people, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to call the King <hi>his Lord,</hi> in his letters, he plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted treason with sundry of the nobles, against the Kings person, intending to put him besides the Crowne, and to cast him in prison; whereof when he was accused from the Kings owne mouth, and could not deny it, he fell on his face with teares, begging pardon from the King.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Edward</hi> the seconds time; the favourites had most of the domineering power in their hands, yet we read that the Bishop of Coventry was a great favourer and abetter of Gaveston.</p>
                  <p>As for Edward the third haveing great warres in hand, and standing in neede of ayde, he called a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at Yorke, whereunto <hi>Iohn Stratford</hi> Archbishop of Canterburie, denied to come: neither would he suffer any of his Bishops, to make their appearance, &amp; all for feare that he should not be suffered to erect his crosse; by which Popish peevish tricke and rebellious part, the King was frustrated of his ends, and the State therby endangered. It is true that this Edward was indeed (as he was called) <hi>Malleus Romanorum.</hi> Yet in his latter dayes that <hi>proud Courtney</hi> made litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him: and so disdainfully affronted his brother Duke of Lancaster, and the Earle of Northumberland (who took the defence of Iohn Wickliffe) that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the madde people against the said noble men, so that they avenged themselves upon their houses and housholdstuffe.</p>
                  <p>Thus your Honours may see in what account the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8853:38"/> branches of the blood Royal are with bloodie &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Prelats. Who will neither spare them (if they maintaine the Gospell) nor spare that good commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, which should save our soules.</p>
                  <p>Richard the 2. was no better served by the saucie Bishop of Norweidge in levying souldiers at the charge of the subjects to fight the Popes battles (contrarie to the Kings command) he was sent for by the King, but he refused to obay, <hi>affirming that going on &amp; action were more necessarie, than to goe speake with the King, it might be to small purpose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To goe on with Henry the 4. supported &amp; put on by these men to disthrone his master a brave Prince, but much abused.</p>
                  <p>They laid hold on the occasion the rather, because he hearkened somwhat to Wickliffe and was not for Romes tooth. They first stirred up a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in Ireland which the King went in person to suppresse, but before his return they had stolne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hearts of his subjects, and set them upon his subject, the Earle of Darby, neither weighing the glorious memorie of the grandfather, nor the the unrepayable desert of the princely father; but thirsting for the blood of the saincts they advanced the said Earle to the crown: that by this they might both rid the King out of the way, and have a King for ever obliged to patronize their blooddie designs against Gods people. And this they did effect. For after the death of <hi>Richard</hi> they incited the King and prevailed with him to enact that blooddie inquisitiō oath, which became the very shambles &amp; butchering house of Gods people.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:8853:39"/>
                  <p>Thus the supreame Magistrate (who should have been the <hi>breath of his people</hi>) was for the maintenance of an Earthlie Crowne, brought to bath in the blood of his best people.</p>
                  <p>This he would never have done, were it not for pleasing of cruell Arundell Archb. of Cant. and his crew, who vowed &amp; sware that <hi>he would not leave one slip of Professors in this Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As some of the same discent <hi>(to their litle Land)</hi> have said litle lesse of the Puritanes (as they call them) th'aforesaid Arundel and his shavelings, the King feared more than God and his Word; And therefore it is an heavie yoke for Kings to be yoked with them. He saw no way in his carnal apprehension to make the Crowne sticke to him and his, but by sacrificieng the blood of Gods people to the persecutors of the saints. But for all this <hi>his owne makers</hi> thought to have marred him. For <hi>Richard</hi> Archbishop of Yorke waged warre against him, and thought to have taken both Crowne and life from him; but he mist of his purpose, and so left his head in pawne.</p>
                  <p>From the time of Henr. the 4. the Prelats (thus fleshed in the butcherie of Gods people) went on to a greater height of tyrannie, adding drunkennes to thirst.</p>
                  <p>They prevail'd with Henr. the 5. to make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and mischeivous statute under pretence of treason against the servants of the most High, whom they called <hi>Heretickes.</hi> That statute in regard of the frame may be called <hi>Monstrous, and blooddie</hi> in respect of the end.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:8853:39"/>
                  <p>The preface of the statute standeth onely upon trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: the bodie of the statute runneth all on <hi>Heresie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> who list to look the statute may at the first view dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the head or root discording with the bodie, and the branches of the bodie, opposing one an other (as ordinarily wicked decrees consist of <hi>non-sence</hi> and <hi>self-confusion</hi>) for so the wise God taketh the foolish in their owne Policie: To go no further;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1603</note> witnesse our late <hi>Non-sence Canons</hi> (to say no more of them.) But to the said statute a little further, the purport and end whereof, was to insnare and calumniate the Professors of truth. For it is a common maxime amongst Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish forgers, <hi>to make the profession of the true Faith (which they call heresie) and treason to be convertible termes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Prelates were the prime movers, yea the instigaters and procurers of this statute, it is clear from the matter, manner, preface, and end of the said statute: for neither could they instance anie such apparance of treason, nor did the King feare anie such treason; but onely their hatred of <hi>Lolardy</hi> (as they called it) and feare of the truths prevailing was the ground of it; and the thing it selfe, a toade ingendred in the Bishops braines: witnesse that clause in the body of the statute, <hi>At the instance &amp; request of the Ordinarie &amp;c.</hi> but what commoditie or comfort had these two Kings from those suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inforced cruelties, by these firie Bishops? Surelie the evill overcame the supposed good, for they by these sinister means, indevouring to make the crown fast upon the heads of them and theirs, provoked the Lord in his blood-revenging-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8853:40"/> to take of their successors <hi>with Fishookes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for themselves, it may well be said of them, (especiallie of Henrie the 4.) that the <hi>stormes</hi> of their troubles, and <hi>fires</hi> of feares, were hotter and greater in life and death then the fires and fryings of the saincts wherein they were consumed to ashes. This may be a good caveat to all christian Princes, not to fasten their crownes, nor to fixe their tents by the cords of the prelates counsells: for it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and observed by sundrie, <hi>that never a King counselled nor State swayed by them, could stand or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in good temper or esteeme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Astronomers observe and experience proves, that when Orion setteth with the sunne, and the Hyades rise with him (though it be in the begining of May) such nipping frosts, sharp haile, and tempestuous storms arise, that the season seemes to be changed, and that because these starrs be of a tempestuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, changing the ayre, and weakening the sweet &amp; powerfull Influence of the Sunne, which till he be ridd of their opposition cannot manifest his vigour. Iust so the malignant and tempestuous power of the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> doth so impede and intercept the sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a Princely temperature and disposition, that doe what he can, all is like to be undone, till he leave <hi>Taurus</hi> or the house of the <hi>horned beast,</hi> which being forsaken, all distempers vanish &amp; his gracious clemencie moves sweetly in the <hi>Gemini</hi> of the Church and common-wealth. Yea we can hardly number how many States and Kings, (besides our owne nation) they have brought either very lowe, or to utter ruine.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:8853:40"/>
                  <p>To go on then with Henr. 6. Left an infant, under the age of one yeare; upon whose harmelesse head God in his accustomary justice, laid the temporall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the parents guilt. His very infancye, that Skarlett Cardinall Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> besprinkled with the blood of Christs Martyrs. Yea, the more blood they drunke, the more they thirsted, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the hott and cruell persecution in that Henries raigne. But somewhat lay in their way, namely that good <hi>Duke of Glocester,</hi> the Kings uncle, the very sword and shield of the King and State, whom they must of necessity have removed.</p>
                  <p>The Bishop of Winchester intended to have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him in the citty of London, but that not taking effect, a Parliament was called at Bury, where they ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at his head, and so thy had it; but what was the cause? Surely nothing, (for all <hi>S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Thomas Moores Cogging</hi>) but onely this, he was a just man and a good Patriott, hateing the Prelats haughtines, and deceiving villanies, loving the truth, and maintaining equity.</p>
                  <p>Where first may it please your Honours to observe the mettle of the Prelats, in fetching off so quickly &amp; so easily, not the head of a <hi>Catelin or Scianus</hi> of a <hi>Spencer</hi> or <hi>Gaviston,</hi> but of a high and nigh Prince of the blood such an one, as well might be called <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of the Country.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all men may hence observe that piety &amp; honestie, hath beene, is, and shallbe, matter enough for the Bishops to make the best fall, if they can find opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. But to the point this worthy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> being removed the Bishops went on with their fiery persecutions, till
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8853:41"/> the Lord sent the spirit of division upon the nation, stirring up these bloody intestine warrs betwixt the house of <hi>Yorke &amp; Lancaster,</hi> wherof the like hath scarce been heard in any nation.</p>
                  <p>To omitt the particulars (as how many Princes of the blood, Nobles, Knights, Gentlemen, fell in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell) In one Battle at Ferry Brigges were slaine (as men say) 30000. besides men of note. Thus the Lord in his justice made them instruments of his revenge one upon another, and who but the persecuting Prelats brought all this evill upon the Land, namely the blood of Gods people, as the provoking cause; the butchering one of another; the ruine of the King, and his race, and the shakeing of the state in peeces? That the Prelats hands were farre in this Kings miscarriage, and bloodie broyles ensuing, it is manifest by their never ceassing-desire, till the good Duke of Glocester (the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour indeed) was cut of. For it is their genuine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, to endure no trustie freind to God, the King or the State.</p>
                  <p>By this both King and State were open to those long enduring, and incomparable evills, tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous rebellions, raised by <hi>Cade &amp; others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which troubles one thing is remarkable, as the very finger of God, that notwithstanding this intestine bloodshed in great abundance, gave fitt oportunity to forraigne invasion; yet that all-wise and just God restrained all forraignes from parting of them, till they had fully wrought the Lords revenge, in slaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another. Hence let a nation addicted to Idolatrie and other sinnes observe. That the Lord will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8853:41"/> make one of them devoure an other, for a long time before he give them up to a forraigne enimie.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zacha.</hi> 11.6</note> And such a course the Lord seemeth to keep with us. But to hasten with the point from the beginning of that blooddie time, till the <hi>two houses of Yorke</hi> &amp; <hi>Lancaster</hi> were united, <hi>there was half an houre silence in Heaven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revell.</hi> 8.1.</note> That is some small peace in the Church, partlie through the obscuritie of Professors, and partlie by the enimies working one upon an other. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Prelats were still doing as they found occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, instance the murthering of Peacocke Bishop of Chichester (as it is recorded) after his recantation.</p>
                  <p>Now to Henrie the 7. in whose time the Lord had no sooner given rest to the State, than they began to make warre upon the Saints, making the King himself an instrument, to subvert the faith of a poore Priest, by his awfull presence, and mandatorie persuasions, with whom the learnedst of their Clergie could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile. Immediatlie upon this they carried the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably seduced man to the fire and burned him. Was not this a fearfull evill against God and the State, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the soule of the King, against both the soule &amp; bodie of the partie seduced? Was not this King (for all his great parts) much vassalled in the Honour of his Majestie, that he could not save (as we may thinke he promised) his supposed convert?</p>
                  <p>With their firie and blooddie courses they went on, to the exceeding great trouble of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as Histories discover at large. And howsoever that King heaped up much treasure, yet quicklie after
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8853:42"/> his death it melted as snow against the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>We goe on with Henr. 8. the former part, of whose time they made an <hi>Aceldama or field of blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How he and all his subjects were abused and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne by the Prelats, as <hi>Gardiner, Bonner,</hi> &amp; <hi>Woolsey,</hi> it is so obvious to everie one, and so fully laid downe in a bill of complaint, called <hi>the beggers petition,</hi> that it is not necessarie to be insisted upon.</p>
                  <p>There it is made plaine, that they were too strong against the King in Parliament, that no good lawes could passe against the wicked of the Land, nor no wicked law against the poore Gospellers could be stopped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Winchester</hi> gott the King to sitt at the arraignment of holy <hi>Lambert,</hi> which he onelie did to humour these blooddie beasts, and to serve his owne ends.</p>
                  <p>To be breife, they made him exceedingly to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, serving themselves with him, disturbing his peace, inward and outward, causing him undeservedlie to cut off his best Freindes, and trustiest servants, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>Cromwell,</hi> because they served God and him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prelats pride and tyrannie.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Queene Mary,</hi> who set all in a flame, she had the fewe from them; that fed her distempered dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against Gods people. What Honours and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, she lost, and how troublesome her State and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8853:42"/> burdensome her life was to her, it is more then evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>But what is all this to our Bishops may some say, these were Popish Bishopps? For answer:</p>
                  <p>First, their doings have so farre proved the point. 2. Ours be no other for order (as we have proved) then Popish Bishops. They are garments cut out of the very same cloth; a paire of sheeres (as we say) went but betweene them; Onely divers hands have cut them out. And to say that our Lord Bishops with all their essentiall and integrall parts (whereof they consist) are not Popish B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. is a contradiction <hi>in adiecto.</hi> They are installed after the same manner, created with the most of the same Ceremonies, they are trimed up in the same trappings, they have the like attendants, the like armes and observancy, they usurp the same power and jurisdiction, and exercise the like tyranny over Ministers and people.</p>
                  <p>But for further proofe of the point concerning their particulars, be pleased (right Honourable) to take a view of their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>To begin with <hi>Edward the sixt</hi> (a gracious plant, whereof our soyle was unworthy) who like an other <hi>Iosias</hi> setting himself with all his strength about refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, did abhorre and forbid, <hi>that any Masse should be permitted to his owne sister.</hi> Further, he was desirous, not to leave a hoofe of the Romish Beast in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as he was taught by some of the sincerer sort.</p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:8853:43"/>
                  <p>But as he wanted Instruments to effect this good, so he was mightilie opposed in all his good designes, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Prelats, which caused him out of a godlie zeale in the very anguish of his heart, to poure out his soule in teares.</p>
                  <p>Their suggestion of false feares to the King, and the seeking of their owne unlawfull standing, brought forth that revived spawne of the beast, <hi>kneeling in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, for the greater reverence thereto whereby the Papists had contentment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly for this, and such like courses, the Lord tooke him away in wrath to this nation, that he might make the furnace of his indignation seaven times hotter against it, whereby he opened the eyes of some good men, who with remorse of heart confessed that sin of theirs against God, against the King, against holy men (resisting <hi>Roomes Reliques</hi>) and against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>To come at last to <hi>Queene Elizabeth (of happie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie)</hi> who having setled her estate, and subverted the profession of Popery, came in th'end to listen to a full reformation, whereunto she was moved (as we are credibly informed) by the Lord <hi>Protector of Scotland,</hi> called <hi>the good Regent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As she honoured him very much and held his words and actions to be of great waight (whatsoever the mungrell Papists affirme to the contrarie) so she
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8853:43"/> gave good respect to these particulars, which he laid downe to her for grounds:</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <p n="1">1. The unvaluable benefit of a faithfull and free Ministry.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. And lastly (though the least in esteeme, yet of no small moment to the good of her state) she might imploy the Prelates overfattening pastures to manie good and profitable uses, leaving the ministrie enough for their Honourable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. As for their glorious and lordly pomp which was pretended much to honour a nation, it did not so indeed; for it justled out Gods honour which should be dearer to Princes then their crowns and liues. And grant that it were some comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true honour; yet the saveing of one soule by the preaching of a powerfull minister was of more worth then all the pomp &amp; glory of the world.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>To this effect was his speach, which the Queene pondered well. But when the Prelates understood what an office he was about, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured exceedingly, and in revenge of that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he had unjust aspertions cast upon him, and hath to this day by some of their traine.</p>
                  <p>At a Parliament holden anno 13. of her Majesties reigne, some Prelates and others were sent from the Convocation house to exhibit to her a subsidie,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8853:44"/> according to the custom, her Majestie spake verie graciouslie concerning the good of Christs Church, affirming that she had heard of manie things in the Church needfull to be reformed, which if she could but come to understand, she would not give sleepe to her eies till she sett vpon reformation, and would never give over till she had done it indeed; and if they, being the eies, would not reveale the truth, let the blame and blood be upon them.</p>
                  <p>But what was their answer to so worthie a motiō? even such as suited with their owne ends, seeking <hi>more</hi> than <hi>theire owne; and not that which is Christs:</hi> like false glasses they presented her Majestie with an <hi>Omnia bene.</hi> And thus they proved the bane of reformation frustrating the desires of a Prince wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of so great a work.</p>
                  <p>After that, in processe of time, they caused a subtile insinuation of the disgrace of discipline to be suggested to the Queene, affirming, if discipline were sett on foot, that everie sillie fellow, or <hi>sit Iohn</hi> in a parish Church, might at his pleasure raile on the Queene, and also excommunicate her. Which (by the Bishops leave) is a verie calumnie, as if the government of Christ should not both knowe and use Kings better, than the government of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. But envie never spake well. In the meane time they neglected no oportunity to persecute such godly ministers as would not conforme, and from citing, vexing, suspending, and casting them out of their free-holds, they fell to pack with some atheistly Iudges; setting them so against the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8853:44"/> good men, that they did not onely scoffe them, belye them and revile them, but also arraigne them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them. Which when the Queene heard, it greived her soule; for she was so farre from having that high injurie put upon Gods Ministers, that she sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified her mind in Parliament to the contrarie, namely <hi>

                        </gap>hat she would not have them vexed for non-conformity.</hi> What ever was mentioned in Parliament for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the first table, the Prelats ever crossed it. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that motion for the sanctifying of the Sabbath in the 37. Eliz. the passing whereof they hindred. So they sett themselves against that course of Sabbath-keeping and reformation of abuses, undertaken by the Magistracie of the citie of London, till at length (to their blame be it spoken) partlie through their owne indisposition to the busines, and partlie through the violence of the Prelats opposing; So high, necessarie and acceptable a duetie, was quite given over. Since which time, we may observe that the Lord hath smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us in Citie and Countrey seaven times more in all conditions and affaires, so that things have prospered worse then ever they did before.</p>
                  <p>The like necessity was laid upon the Citie in the raign of Richard the second, <hi>to take the punishment of filthines upon them, (being rather increased then curbed or restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the clergies courses,)</hi> at which reformation they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so grumbled.</p>
                  <p>What shall we say of the attempts of some of them (whereof some are dead, and some were lately alive) against his late Majesties succession to this Crowne, upon conceived feares and jealousy of <hi>Church refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi>

In so much that whē they heard he was proclaimd K. of Engl. they tore their hayre, being unable to resist, and without all hope of pardon. Yet the King (out of his gracious clemencye with much adoe, and after much importunate mediation) was content to pardon it. Yea we make bould under your Honours favour to put this <hi>quaere.</hi> Whether any of the Prelats for the time being, did affect his succession? Let them speake in conscience.</p>
                  <p>Come we further to consider the late Kings dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition at his first entry; for any thing we could perceive he was well affected to the <hi>Anti-episcopall</hi> government (with which he was trained up from his cradle, and which by word and writ he had maintained) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to preserve at his comming out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> His good thoughts also to such reverend men as these men scornfully called <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> were lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in his <hi>Basilicon Doron.</hi> Yea can it stand with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason that a King should graciously pardon his professed foes; and not affect his dearest freinds, by whom (as by secondary meanes) he was kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from his very infancie?</p>
                  <p>But for all this so soone as they had him here, and had calmed the stormy feares of <hi>Prelat-splitting,</hi> against the rock of his displeasure, they began to shew him all the <hi>glory of the World,</hi> and to forge false accusations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Brethren, as though they had been the <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of Israell,</hi> whereby (it might be) his mind was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8853:45"/> somewhat exasperated: Yet not so, nor with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Ministers should be oppressed as they were indeed without <hi>any judgement;</hi> Witnesse his owne course of reasoning, with the non-conforming Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, seconded with commandement given, to deale with them by <hi>reason and dispute,</hi> and not with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. But how the Prelats obeyed, let the evill and base usage, the suspending, silencing, thrusting out of their livings, so many hundred Ministers, beare witnesse to the world. It is worthy your Honours observation that in Anno 1604. and 1605. 400. Ministers were silenced suspended, or thrust out by vertue of those wicked Canons, which were not concluded by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation (for D. Rud opposed them by an oration) but they were the Popish <hi>after-byrth</hi> of B. Bancroft then B. of London; Hatched as it is verily thought in the braines of his ghuests the <hi>Seminaries.</hi> This was not unlike that practise of Trent, in pressing of the <hi>Interim</hi> upon the Germane Ministers and other Protestants, for refusall whereof thy were removed, and many were banished.<note place="margin">Sleydam Comment.</note> Yet <hi>Harman</hi> B. of <hi>Colen</hi> would rather renounce his Bishops Sea, than be an Agent in it, who may stand up as a witnes against our Prelats. But what followed on this sylenceing of our Ministers even that <hi>Master-peece</hi> of Rome, <hi>the gunpowder plott</hi> brought to the very period of accomplishment. As God might in justice have punished the former evill with the latter (for our Kings and State have often smarted for the Prelats plaguegy courses:) so if you will be pleased to looke further into the <hi>conjunction</hi> of these evills, you may find them both to be poysonable
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8853:46"/> fruites of the same <hi>tree of death.</hi> Yea happily it may probably appeare upon good inquiry, that he that was the maine agent in the former had his finger in the later.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the better clearing whereof; may your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours be pleased to enquire, whether Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> retained not Watson the Priest for his owne private plotts; whom he suffered to divulge dangerous books against the State and right of the Crowne?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Also whether the said Bishop had not intelligence with the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Venice</hi> and the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries?</hi> And whether <hi>Blackwell</hi> the Arch-Priest before his apprehension was not by the said B. protected?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What was the cause he posted on the filenceing of so many Ministers, to the number of 400. (as hath been shewed) immediatlie before the discovery of the gunpowder treason? After which discovery he wrote to the other Bishops, that they should not hould that course of silenceing manie at once, but that they should be silenced by one and one. For it seemes if that <hi>grand busines of Hell</hi> had taken effect the blame should have been laid on the <hi>harmlesse hoast of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> as though it had been done by <hi>Puritanes</hi> in revēge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let it be inquired whether one of the Popes speciall intelligencers, confessed to a seeming malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that if the powder-plott had taken effect, <hi>B. Banc.</hi> should have been Pope, &amp; Father <hi>Bluet,</hi> Cardinal of all England▪</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:8853:46"/>5. Whether <hi>B. Banc.</hi> &amp; others his accomplices had not correspondencie with the King of Spaine?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not unworthy the inquirie what became of <hi>Bluet,</hi> after the discoverie of the powder-treason? It's certaine, that with <hi>B. Banckroft</hi> he was, but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of him no bodie knowes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Whether <hi>B. Banc.</hi> his intimate confederates, were not speciall maintainers of the Prelacie, opposers of the Gospell, &amp; good Ministers of God, yea &amp; no good freinds to the State?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And lastlie, may your Honours be pleased to inquire, whether some of our present Prelats, use not Iesuites in the habite of gallants, as their familiars? and whether (looking for a change) some of them ayme not to be <hi>head,</hi> or at least to be as nigh the <hi>head</hi> as they can, that they may do their M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. the more service?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For evidence of this, let their Popish Positions &amp; practises, &amp; maintaining of them in others (of which we can give too manie instances) speak in the first place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Their cruel persecution of the Ministers doth evidence the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And lastlie, their breathing out of threatenings against conscionable (tho conforming Ministers) and these they meane to make good (because they cannot endure the Gospell) except the Lord make you to the same, a place of refuge &amp; defence they mean to root it out. If they be left to the Prelats mercie, the woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full event will shew it to be no slaunder.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:8853:47"/>
                  <p>For 1. as hath beene shewed they cannot subsist with the continuance of a faithfull Ministrie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They will provide for themselves in their kind.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They can do the Pope no greater service, and the Kingdome of Christ no greater injurie than in this particular.</p>
                  <p>If their places disposed them not for the Pope, they would never disarme the Kingdome of the States best forces, and the Popes greatest adversaries. Its true that there be some Prelats <hi>Rampant</hi> and some Prelats <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chāt,</hi> but your Honours know they be all the <hi>Popes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats.</hi> They have divers kinds of <hi>teeth,</hi> but all their <hi>teeth</hi> bite. In a word, as hath been shewed, the members must doe for the head, and in this they doe but their kinde. Therfore if you would save both them and us, <hi>alter the propertie from Lord Bishops to Ministers</hi> so shall you spoyle the Pope; preserve the State, and you shall have the Honour through the world that they are your converts.</p>
                  <p>But to go on a litle further with this disease of the <hi>Prelats evill,</hi> especiallie against the Ministerie.</p>
                  <p>Besides the injurye done to soules, it would make an heart of stone to relent to heare related the insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, scofferies, outrages, revileings and barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by them, and theirs put upon the faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of God, and their poore families. Though many
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8853:47"/> sufferers in this busines be with God; yet there be some alive that can both relate, and witnesse the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to themselves and others, by breaking into their howses; by draging themselves, Wives and Families to prison (and that without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at all) the casting of them, &amp; theirs out of doores, giving them scarce a ragge of their owne Cloathes to cover their childrens nakednes. We humbly intreate your Honours, not to passe by those crying injuries, which you will the rather observe and be sencible of, if you take a view of the fearefull by-past sequells of those evills.</p>
                  <p>At his late Majesties entry, the Lord (fore-knowing how little should be done for him, and how much against him) sent an admonitory persuing <hi>plague,</hi> for heat and continuance rarely matched, speaking to the eye of King and State, that there was some speciall <hi>plague</hi> to be removed; and what other and greater, and more worthy the care of a King and State, then <hi>Romish Idolls,</hi> in Gods worship, and <hi>Antichristian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> which evills increasing, (though the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the plague,) yet he hath smitten us <hi>seaven times more,</hi> in bodyes, states, and names, namely in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper of the Elements, in the change of seasons, in the languishing, groaneing and dying of the Creatures, under the burthen of our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>And above all temporall punishments, in taking away our <hi>Henry,</hi> that <hi>Paragon</hi> of Princes, who should have been, and would have been, (if our sinnes had not hindred) <hi>Malleus Episcoporum,</hi> which worke no
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8853:48"/> doubt with Romes ruine in England our <hi>Great Charles,</hi> will accomplish, if <hi>his army of Princes,</hi> namely you <hi>great Senatours</hi> act your part. Now to draw to an end of their by-past mischeifs, let the subiects take notice, what high indignity they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his late Maiesty, by whose perswasions, when some ministers had conformed, they used the said ministers (onely for preaching the Gospel) <hi>seaven times worse</hi> than before, notwithstanding the Kings command to the <hi>contrary.</hi> Not unlike for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty (for we parallell not all) to the burning of that priest perswaded by Henry the seaventh, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly spoken of.</p>
                  <p>Since this greivance then, is made good by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable proofs, give us leave (right honourable) by way of dutie, and by deserved retortion, to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for our selves from the aspersion of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and their children, in their venemous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, railings, and writings; we are (say they) <hi>seditious, tumultuous, factious, disobedient, rebellious,</hi> in a word <hi>the troublers of Israel:</hi> and they would gladly <hi>we were cut off, because we trouble them.</hi> But give us leave in homely phrase to set the saddle on the right horse, and to tell them, <hi>they and their fathers house, are the troublers of Israel.</hi> Let them never tell us of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing over magistrates, by depriving them of their rights, by excommunication &amp;c. Let them not object to us <hi>M. Vdall &amp; M. Cartwright &amp;c.</hi> as seditious fellowes, or traitours, if they had beene such, our late King would never have written his letters to Queen Elizabeth on their behalfe, as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8853:48"/> he verily did. Let them direct their speeches to the <hi>Bishops of London, Ely, Winchester,</hi> interdictors of the King, and the whole realme. Anselme against <hi>Rufus;</hi> Beckett vexeing Henry the second; Langton casting away King and State; Arundell, unkinging Richard the second; In plaine termes, these men were the traytors, and yet no <hi>Presbyterian Brethren,</hi> but <hi>Lord Bishops,</hi> whose brethren and successours our Prelats are.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bishop of Hereford,</hi> preaching at Oxford on the text: <hi>Oh my head! Oh my head aketh!</hi> (as the vulgar latin hath it, 2. Kings 4.19.) applyed it thus peremptorily against <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Kings head must of necessity be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</hi>

                  <p>And so much for the proofe of this point, in the later part whereof we have been sparing of particular names in the passages of our proofes, because we love not to stigmatise any particular person, (dead or alive) since it is the evills of their callings, and not persons, which we oppose.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The horrour of this sinne of silenceing Ministers for not subscribing, &amp; the fearfull evills ensueing on it, is set forth in a speach of the Lower house of Parl.

                  </p>
                  <p>So we may instance in all the other sinnes, as <hi>Heresie, Schisme,</hi> instance <hi>Popery, Anabaptisme, Seperatisme, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme,</hi> &amp; <hi>Familisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their uphoulding of Popish grounds, lawes, rites &amp; tyranny in the Churches of England, and over the Ministers and people, give the Papists more then hopes
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8853:50"/> of returning to their possessions, with the overtopping authoritie of the Pope, whose hornes keepe possession for him, keeping Christ at the doore, and pushing out the meanes, by which he should enter. For the same grounds and arguments that the former stand on, and use, are the very best armes, offensive &amp; defensive, that the later have.</p>
                  <p>Also the Anabaptists, seeing the grosse abuse and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced interpretations of the scriptures, not onely delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but also pressed upon others, together with the unsound Doctrine and corruptions of Ministers, and the <hi>Dumbe Dogges,</hi> which be in manie places, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the word &amp; other ordinances, and fall upon their owne <hi>fantasticke revelations</hi> and damnable fooleries.</p>
                  <p>They are also the Authors of the <hi>Seperatists scisme,</hi> which hath both the rise, &amp; increase from the Prelacie, with whose superstitious corruptions the sincerer people at first denyed to joyne; and so being driven from their Homes &amp; Countries, into forraigne parts, manie of them tooke up strange and unsound conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which to this day they hould of the Churches &amp; best people thereof; and duties therein performed, which practise of their seperation butteth full upon the unreasonable &amp; unsound reasoning of the Bishops in this manner:</p>

                     <hi>or of some essentiall part in it self (though not of the whole) is no sufficient ground for seperation.</hi> All the Prelats procters ply the Reformers (as they call them) with the aforesaid insnaring Proposition, as it were with warme Cloathes.

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:8853:51"/>2. The seperatists stumble at the pride, rapine, and tyrannie of the Prelates, as also at the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable servilitie and slaverie of ministers and people; at their ungodly courses, their illegall and cruell proceedings, by all which they are forced (for want of better <hi>take heede) upon the quicksands of seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and that the rather, because the Prelates argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against them are either poperie or prison.</p>

This more plainly appeareth, that in both the last Parliaments, it being earnestly opposed by the most of the lower house and manie of the higher house, the Prelacie rather did befreind it (at least under hand) then oppose it, which since hath manifested it selfe by the aboundance of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and pleaders for it.</p>
                  <p>Lastlie, for the <hi>Familists,</hi> they observe the swelling pride, averice, sweareing, forswearing and simonie of the Prelats.

                  <p>To begin with the last first (because in the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of good and lawfull officers consisteth the supreame and principall good of the Church) The calling of L. Bishops hath bene sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to be Antichristian, and consequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by this commandement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Catalog. Test. veritat. Beza.</note>The learned make mention of three sorts of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, the first wherof they call <hi>a divine, or christian Bishop;</hi> because it hath its institution from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all one (as the ancient show,<note place="margin">Hier. ad Evag. in Ier. c. <hi>22.</hi> &amp;c.</note> at large, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves very well know) with a <hi>Minister</hi> or <hi>Elder.</hi> This ordinance of God and practise Apostolicall continued, as the foresaid authoritie observeth, for the space of 300. yeare and upward.</p>
                  <p>After this followeth that <hi>Humane Episcopacie</hi> (as they term it) wherein the pride of man began to vēt it self in an affected title of <hi>superioritie,</hi> yet without any <hi>overlording power</hi> over their brethren and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Ministers, as doth plainly appeare by the places and cariages of the ancient Fathers, who looked not so loftily upon their <hi>fellow-brethren,</hi> as some of our pontificall Parsons doe upon their neighbour Ministers; yea as great difference there is betwixt them and the present Lord Bishops, as is between a <hi>Venetian Duke</hi> and the great <hi>Duke of Muscovie,</hi> of which, the former hath but the bare title of <hi>Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,</hi> and is guided and directed by the Senat, and the later doth what he will against all Law and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

                  <p>The last and worst is, that <hi>Antichristian</hi> or <hi>Satanicall Prelacie,</hi> (for so they term it,) having it's rise from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacius</hi> the 3. in Anno 607. the branches of this root are our Lord Bishops, (as hath been fully shewed,) who by their very callings make the prime and main breach in this commandment, and what blessing can men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? or why should they intertain such Officers in a function of so high a nature, as countermandeth the commandment of God?</p>
                  <p>In the next place we come to shew how their devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Gods worship are just such as their calling, namely, directly against the tenure of this said com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; For that God (who will &amp; should alone be worshipped) should by all reason onelie prescribe how he will be worshipped; whatsoever worship therefore is not of his prescription, is condemned under the name of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and so it is indeed,<note place="margin">

                  <p>From the book of the Ceremonies, which are the <hi>burthens of the Church; the blemish of Gods ordinances, the scourge of good Preachers; the brood and hopes of Poperie; the rejoycing of the profane; the greivance of the good, and the verie seede of dissention.</hi> Time will not suffer to rip up the rotten <hi>Pedigree,</hi> the <hi>Authors, maintainers, evill ends</hi> &amp; <hi>Pestiferous effects</hi> of them. Neither is it necessarie here to demonstrate by way of dispute, the unlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them; since whole volumes are extant against them, and everie particular of them, that can never be answered; It is enough (as we have shewed) that they are directlie against the second Commandment, being in verie deede <hi>The thresholds and posts of Idolaters,</hi>

                  <p>This is the main ground of all the enormities and deformities in Gods worship, that the most ministers do not or dare not teach, and the Prelates with the

                  </p>
                  <p>If those rites did ceasse by which God himselfe did instruct the world: it is an impudēt part to presse others in their place. But the former is true. Ergo the later. For the later part of the evidence, namely, <hi>de facto</hi> there is proofe enough.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. For the evill effects of it. 1. It maketh the most account more of it, then of Baptisme it selfe. 2. Some refuse to be witnesses, unlesse it be used. 3.

                  <p>Now we come to the Arguments against it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we desire to be as breif as we can. And first from the ground spoken of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which had no good beginning, nor ever any good use in Gods worship should not be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a signe of grace.</p>
                  <p>But the Crosse in Baptisme had no good beginning, nor ever any good use in Gods worship (as hath been shewed:)</p>
                  <p>Ergo it should not be appointed for a signe of grace in Gods worship.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Minor</hi> of this argument is onely contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; So we desire the maintainers of the Crosse, to shew us some good beginning or good use of it, if they can.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every signe or <hi>Seale of an evidence,</hi> without the <hi>Counsell of the Lord or Owner,</hi> and every military badge without the appointment of the <hi>grand Commander</hi> is counterfaite.</p>
                  <p>But the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme, is such a signe or military badge.</p>
                  <p>Ergo it is counterfaite.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Major:</hi> Reason cleareth it. Neither can that Distinction of a <hi>signe significative</hi> &amp; <hi>exhibitive</hi> make any evasion. For 1. the Distinction hath no ground from the word. 2. They give the Crosse no small part of <hi>exhibition,</hi> witnesse the words. 3. We must not add a signe <hi>significative</hi> or <hi>explicative</hi> in Gods worship (take what termes they will:) for this is <hi>Gods
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8853:57"/> prerogative.</hi> This <hi>Proposition</hi> is also proved very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly by <hi>D. Fulke:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That many speake</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the Signe of the Crosse,</hi>

                     </note>
                     <hi>it is true; but they speake besides the booke of God: And therefore their reasons are to be rejected. For men must not compare, or joyne the Crosse with the Kings stamp; for he appointed no such, whereby his servants might be knowne, but onely Baptisme.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nemo potest &amp;c. de Sacr. Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Cap. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> Yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth as much. <hi>No man</hi> (saith he) <hi>can bring in, or determine any thing in a Law or Common-weale, but he that is the Author of the Law, and head of the Common-weale;</hi> which he instanceth in the legall Ceremonies. But did God (the author of his owne law, and appointer of his owne worship) bring in, or determine this signe? No sure. Which serveth also for proofe of the <hi>Minor;</hi> For they call it the <hi>signe of the Crosse in Baptisme;</hi> they make it a <hi>military badg;</hi> and lastly it wanteth Gods <hi>determination:</hi> and therfore as a counterfaite to be abandoned.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument followeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Every Image or similitude for a religious use is forbidden by the 2. Commandment.</p>
                  <p>But the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme, is a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for religious use.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, it is forbidden by the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>With this Chardge <hi>D. Morton</hi> is so pusled, that he denyeth <hi>any likenes or Image</hi> to be forbidden by the second Commandment, but an <hi>outward resemblance</hi> of

                  <p n="4">4. That which is mans invention, and hath been an Idoll in Gods worship, must still be an Idoll in Gods worship, and therefore to be abolished.</p>
                  <p>But the Crosse in Baptisme is mans invention, and hath been an Idoll in Gods worship.</p>
                  <p>Ergo it must be an Idoll still in Gods worship, and by consequence to be abolished.</p>
                  <p>We prove the <hi>Major</hi> by induction.</p>
                  <p>Every Idoll in Heathenish worship, was still an Idoll in the worship of God;<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 16. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.3.</note> As the Alter of Damascus.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8853:58"/> Deut. 16.21. And so of all the rest Deut. 7.5. Yea, things appointed by God for a time, if they become Idolls, or polluted with Idolatrous worship, they must be done away. Witnesse the <hi>Brasen Serpent,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now let our opponents give an instance (besides the matter in hand) as the law of Logick requireth, and we will quit them all the rest.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Minor,</hi> namely, that <hi>the Crosse is Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and hath been an Idoll,</hi> we thinke no Protestant will deny. Witnesse their <hi>ascribing of Divine vertue</hi> to it; yea they adore it.</p>

                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:8853:59"/>
                  <p>The common answer to such Arguments as this, is from the 30. Canon; Papists (say they) abused it fowly but we use it better?</p>
                  <p>For answer. 1. This is not to answer, for we have proved, that it is not to be used at all. It is a common excuse of <hi>corrupt practise</hi> (saith one of their owne) <hi>to use meanes abused by others in Gods worship, to a better end. Yea it is a resolution too plausible to wordly wisdome.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. For use, is there not in word as much attributed to it by us (if not more) as by the Papists?

                  <p>To conclude the Argument in a word: The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats Crosse is the same <hi>specie, or in figure.</hi> It is the same also for the especiall signification, namely, <hi>to be a signe of Christ, and the efficacie of his death.</hi> So that (as one saith) he retaineth entirely his old Idolls office.

                  <p>The last Argument followeth well upon this, namely:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the badge of the beast,</hi> which manifest 1. by the Papists challenging of it, to be the special marke and badge of their Idolatrous worship; witnesse <hi>Stapleton,</hi>

                  <p>Further, they doe not onely doe, and maintaine these things, but also they presse the practise of them upon the subjects, and that often maugre their consciences,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8853:61"/> and that by threatning, punishing of their purse &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment. Moreover they force the Ministers and young Schollers to subscribe to the aforesaid 5. Books, two of which, scarce one amongst manie have seene. The matter of their subscription, as hath been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is this, <hi>That nothing contained in the said Books, is contrarie to the word of God.</hi> Whence it must follow, that Ceremonies and other things in question, must <hi>be warranted by the word.</hi> For as they cannot denie <hi>that whatsoever is beside the word, is against the word:</hi> so whatsoever (especially in Gods worship) is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word, is warranted by the word. By which deduction the pressours of these things and subscribers to hem, put them upon the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> for by it, they must either stand or fall. Now thus to put upon God the thing, that he <hi>never commanded, nor ever came into his heart to command,</hi> as himself speaketh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.31.</note> how high a sin it is, and how neare to <hi>blasphemie,</hi> we leave it to be judged.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whereas all outward means of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by th'Affirmative of this commandment are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and the due performance thereof required, the Prelats persecute and thrust out the faithfull Ministers, which be the <hi>Messengers of the Word, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of God, the Breakers of the bread of life;</hi> and with idle and <hi>Idoll sheapheards</hi> (the slayers of the people) they fill up their places: how manie such they thrust in and keep in, we cannot number.</p>
                  <p>They are Fathers &amp; Favourers of the soul-murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sinnes of <hi>Non-residencie</hi> &amp; <hi>pluralitie,</hi> condemned
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8853:62"/> by all the Laws that can be named: Neither can these consist with the office of a Pastor.</p>
                  <p>We will give but a touch, because we have a whole treatise against those sinnes, which your Honours may command.</p>
                  <p>Never Papist so shamelesse, as to plead or write for these sinnes (so farr as we know) yet some among us are not ashamed to doe both. But this is no better then to plead and write for <hi>bloud-guiltinesse,</hi> and to warrant it by a law. The maine <hi>non-residents</hi> be their <hi>Lords</hi> &amp; <hi>Masters;</hi> by reason whereof they become Patrons, to impropriate patrons, whom they have taught to sin, &amp; maintayne sin by president.</p>
                  <p>Another sin against the Ordinances, is the Iustlinge out of the reading of the word of God, to the number of 196 chapters, or there about, yea &amp; some whole Books of Scripture: in place whereof 134. chapters of the Apocrypha are thrust in, as of more use, edification and esteeme with them; witnesse, their making of Scripture, to give place to the Apocrypha, upon a <hi>speciall feast,</hi> though it fall on the <hi>Lords day.</hi> And this is done, or to be done by the <hi>Calender</hi> 20. several times in the year.</p>
                  <p>Yet more sinne against the Ordinances: to passe by their Lenton superstitious fast, <hi>with the expectation of Popish Discipline</hi> in that particular, they keep out and hinder true fasting indeed, to the shame of this <hi>Nation,</hi> &amp; the halling on of inevitable destructiō upō our heads witnes that of Isaie: <hi>In that day I called for weeping, &amp;c.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8853:62"/> but behold, &amp;c. Surely that iniquitie shall not be purged from you till you dye,</hi> saith the Lord of hoasts:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Isay.</hi> 22.13 14.</note> this speech may make our eares tingle and hearts tremble.</p>
                  <p>If a Fast at length be appointed, the Prelats will be sure to watch for spoyling of the pot with one <hi>Coloquintida</hi> or other of their owne invention. Wherfore we beseech your Honours, as you tender Gods Honour, and desire his presence to your procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, looke to your Fasts, that <hi>death be not in the pot;</hi> that instead of pacifying of an <hi>angrie God,</hi> ye provoke him not more. For it is not more naturall for Prelats to eat &amp; drink, then from their hearts to hate <hi>a Fast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Manie reasons we might give, but we desire this one to be thought on. If this dutie were kept up, and set on foote upon all the right Limmes, &amp; duely plyed <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> upon every just motive, they know it would finde them out to be <hi>nostri fundi calamitas, the very bane of our being:</hi> yea this would blow them up, and all our sinnes &amp; enimies with them. In this their hatred and feare of the duetie appeareth: <hi>If anie gather themselves together</hi> (as the Lord commandeth) to stay (if it be possible) the comming forth of the decree, they are watched with <hi>Argus eyes,</hi> and dragged along by <hi>Briarius</hi> his hands, as it were in despitefull opposition to God and his service, against the Laws of the Land, against the Crowne &amp; Dignitie of the King, against the temporall and eternall good of the State.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:8853:63"/>
                  <p>Yet this is not all, but if Gods people in their families upon the Lords day fall to chew the cud, by the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sermon, helping some neighbours that have not such meanes; they are without regard of the day, Gods ordinance, or God himself, halled or hurried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prelate; some are kept in pursuivants hands, some bound over at no lesse cost then vj<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. or a noble a peece, some having scarse so much more in the world, <hi>O tempora! O mores!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To shut up the further prosecution of the breaches of this precept; <hi>Where is the key of Discipline?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>Discipline,</hi> is the <hi>soule</hi> of warre; the spirit of Policie: so it is the <hi>Scepter</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> swaying his owne house, according to his hearts desire.</p>
                  <p>And as a body without a <hi>soule;</hi> a Camp or State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Policie</hi> are either dead carkasses, or bodies so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, that they either do nothing, or that which is worse then nothing: so a Church without Discipline, is a <hi>Lethargicall,</hi> or <hi>Apoplecticall</hi> body, wanting that <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal spirit,</hi> which should open and expell the drossie vapors of <hi>sin,</hi> and organise the said body.</p>
                  <p>Discipline is the cheife commander in the Camp-Royall of God. It driveth the nayle into the temples of <hi>Rebellion</hi> it self. This is the onely best <hi>physitian,</hi> for the purging out of <hi>peccant</hi> and pertinacious humours, the onely Chirurgian for wounds and festered sores; and an exquisite bone-setter for fractures or luxations. This is Christs owne Key, that shutteth out enimies &amp; entertaineth freinds; In a word, it is the best guarde &amp; forte; muniment &amp; munition; Notwithstanding of all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8853:63"/> this excellencie, as the <hi>Synagoge</hi> of Rome, and all the Limbs of that confused <hi>Babell,</hi> like nothing worse then the Discipline of Christs camp, so the most of our nation may say with sorrow and greife in hearte, as the Disciples said to Paul of the Holie Ghost:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts.</hi> 19.2.</note>
                     <hi>We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holie Ghost:</hi> so all this time we have scarcely heard whether there be any such thing as <hi>Discipline.</hi> And is not this grosse affected ignorance, yea a fearfull judgment inflicted on us? For as sure as Christ hath a house, so sure he hath <hi>keyes</hi> to that house, and that no moe, no fewer, nor other, then he hath appointed.</p>
                  <p>These, men may not chop, change, or counterfaite at their pleasure (except they will turne <hi>Picklocks.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

So that Discipline or Church-government is a maine Key of the Kingdome of Heaven. Can anie man think that Christ would leave his house destitute of some forme of governm<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>(being faithfull in all his house as Moses) was?</hi>

                     <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, compleate forme of Policie or government of Christs Church to be found in the Scriptures:</hi> which is flat against Scripture, practise, and reason, as hath been fully proved in a work unanswerable: for they may as well say, that Christ hath no howse; as to affirme it to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8853:64"/> be changable which cannot be to the better, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not at all. It is true the prelates (enimies to Christs government) speake contumeliously of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, calling it <hi>a fancy</hi> or <hi>novelty, a meere humane devise,</hi> and they would beare the world in hand that <hi>Calvin was the first authour of it,</hi> as D. Downham, B. Bilson, Saravia; &amp; B. King: but they doe just in this, as the Papists doe with our religion, who will haue Luther to be the authour of it. In this the Prelates opinion and practise, is much like that of the Lacedemonians, defended by Plato, namely <hi>to haue no walls about their Cities, but the citizens valour:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7.</hi> de Opt.

                  </p>
                  <p>The utilitie and necessity of dicipline cannot enough be expressed. It is a speciall note of the <hi>Church,</hi> though not constituting a Church, yet flowing properly from the essence of a Church.

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:8853:64"/>
                  <p>They themselves confesse that some forme of government is necessarie (as B. Whitgift, Bancroft, Bilson, Downham) for they hold it as <hi>Keckerman</hi> speaketh <hi>a Cyclopicall,</hi> or confused multitude <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>This is the guard that keepeth out errours of doctrine, and corruptions of manners: this is the sithe that cutteth downe sin, this maketh the tallest rebell in sin to stoope; this strengtheneth the hands and comforteth the hearts of Gods people; this maketh a sweete harmonie and concinne order in the Church and common wealth,</hi> as appeareth by that cōmon-weal of Geneva formerly instanced, admired by all nations that looke vpon it with a single eie.

                  <p>If any thing by God his good hand passe the presse, either at home or abroad, which crosseth their tenour, or speaketh home for the tenour of Christ, it must either go through <hi>purgatory,</hi> or through the <hi>fire,</hi> such is their expurgatory tryall.

                  <p>They invert the order, they take away both que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and answers, they turne affirmatives into nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and negatives into affirmatives, a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances we can give, but let a taste suffice.

                  <p>To the 4. Commandment, (besides their exemplarie prophaning of the Lords day, by themselves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies) it is a lamentable case to heare &amp; see how in their Commēcements by Schoole disputes, in their Sermons and Discourses, the moralitie of the Sabbath is brought in question, and to the great dishonour of God, and greife of his people, they maintaine the <hi>Non-morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it.</hi> And not onely so, but they oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the reformation and keeping of it; witnesse their hand against the Magistracie of the Citie of London in that busines. And for that <hi>flying Rooke of toleration, for prophaning of the Sabbath,</hi> the desire of the monstrously prophane, and the procurement of some Prelate, concurred to the begetting of it, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it to be authorised.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they take off the leaders of Gods families in the sanctifying of the Sabbath. And so much (as breif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we could) for the sinnes of the first table, takeing footing and butting upon the Prelats.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the sinnes of the second Table: First, they sinne with a high hand against the K.

                  <p>To give an instance of these evill Offices, we have heard that the King upon occasion given, inquired of the Venetian extraordinarie <hi>Ambassadours,</hi> what meanes the people in their territories and other Isles of Italie had for their soules; They made answer to this effect, that their leiturgie and Booke of Homelies (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned in number to the Sabbaths of the yeare) were read in their Churches. Alas! (said the King) that is poore stuffe. To the which a Prelate (being by) replyed: <hi>That it should be better for his Majesties
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8853:67"/> State, and the State of his Kingdomes, if there were me Homilies, and lesse preaching:</hi> For there was more love (said he) among subjects themselves, more loyaltie to their Prince, more prosperitie to the State, <hi>when it was so, then since the time that nothing would serve but preaching.</hi> At which speech the King looked hard upon him, and said no more.</p>
                  <p>If the learned Iudges, and learned Counsellers at law, and all understanding Statesmen doe hould and professe it a principle of State, that <hi>Suggestours</hi> &amp; <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatours</hi> of a King, to cutt the coards of his owne laws, are worthie of condigne punishment in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; what are these men worthie that incite the King to neglect or reject the <hi>Commandments of his God?</hi> To that purpose another of them, as we are informed, told the same King: <hi>That all the Church should never be at rest, till such two worthie Ministers</hi> (whose names we spare) <hi>were hanged up, one in the South, another in the North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are against the Honour of the King. For as it was a staine to the good Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> (notwithstanding all their carefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and maintenance of true religion,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 22 43. 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 14.4 18.14.23.25.</note>) that they tooke not away the high places (instance <hi>Amazia</hi> &amp; <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>) which high places <hi>Hezechia</hi> &amp; <hi>Iosia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, to the great Honour of their names; so these men wonderfully eclipse (if not deface) the Honour of our Soveraigne, not onely in stateing the <hi>Aultar of Damascus,</hi> that is their owne or Popish Ceremonies,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8853:68"/> with the Altar of Gods ordinances, but in suffering <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> to shew his face openly; which must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie make the wrath of God break in upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.2.</note>
                     <hi>It is the Kings Honour,</hi> (saith Salomon) <hi>to search out a matter from the bottom</hi> (as the word signifieth) which is to be understood in things concerning Gods glorie, his owne Honour, and the good of the State: but they vaile our Soveraigne in the first of these; which indeed should be the <hi>perspective</hi> to the rest, to bring them home in their due <hi>quantities;</hi> how then should his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour truely flourish?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they transgresse highly against his Royall Crowne and Dignitie (as hath beene shewed) in the maintenance of forraigne jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they are against his prerogative Royall, not onely maintaining their calling to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> but also in keeping Courts in their owne name.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, they weaken the strength of the Kings state: For as the hovering of the Israelites mindes after Sauls house, weakned the pillars of the house of <hi>David</hi> (though annointed and established by the Lord) so the hovering of our <hi>English Romanists,</hi> after Romes <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> doth distract &amp; <hi>enervate</hi> dangerously the strength of his Majesties state. And who be the main poles of the tent of their hope, but the <hi>Prelacie?</hi> encouraging them further by suppressing and disgracing Romes cheifest adversaries under the name of the <hi>Puritans.</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:8853:68"/> So that which is the weakening of his freinds; is the strengthening of his foes. And that thus they doe, let their Canons, Advertisements, visitation Articles, their open clamours and calumnies from pulpits (comparing them with Iesuits,) and lastly, their dayly proceeding against them in their Courts beare witnesse.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, they devour the Kings wealth, for as the wealth of the subject, is the wealth of the King, so the impoverishing and spoyling of the subject, is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing and spoyling of the King. For exacting from the subject: let first a <hi>Quaere</hi> be made, whether they rake not out of the Ministers <hi>vijs &amp; modis compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis computandis an</hi> 100000 <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And asmuch more out of the peoples purses for visitation sees, pleas, and jangling matters, besides the great summes they raise for probats of wills; what a rable of Officers, as Chancellours, Commissaries, Archdeacons, and others, keepe they for the emptying of the peoples purses, and filling of the land full of all manner of sinne, as swearing, drunkennes, whoredome, pride, Idlenesse, &amp;c. witnesse their filthie and rotten speeches, in disgrace of Gods people, which we loathe to name, as also their patronising of sinne, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueing of Professours in their Courts; what a number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse number of <hi>Mothes,</hi> drones, and <hi>Caterpillers,</hi> they keepe in their Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches, we are not able to expresse. Some have summed them up to the number of 22000. or there about, what a huge deal of meanes will so many <hi>Sharks</hi> devoure.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:8853:69"/>7. And lastlie, they are against the safetie of his Majesties person, maintaining the hopes of Popish traytors, who upon all occasions are readie to attempt, and commit treason against him and the State; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the manie plotts and deepe treasons, contrived against our Kings and State this 68. yeares; As they sin against the King, so they sinne against all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; As first against his Ministers, from whom and whose families (against the Laws of God and the land) they have taken both <hi>liveliehood</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> for some have finished their lives in prison; and some at this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poore and aged, have much adoe to gett bread to eat, but worse then all this, they stoppe their Ministrie, which is dearer to them then life and libertie. How bitterlie and baselie have they abused them in their Courts and palaces; what numbers have they at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times silenced?</p>

                  <p>But in verie deed their <hi>quarrell</hi> is against the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell; which cannot stand (as we have shewed) with the standing of the <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> For it is cleare both against the statute, and the late Kings minde in his Conference at Hampton Court, that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8853:69"/>
                     <hi>men once admitted, should be ejected or cast out for not-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing.</hi> Citing that of the Poet:
<q>Turpius ejecitur quam non admittitur hospes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They sin exceedinglie against the good estate and sanctimonie of the Kings <hi>houshold government,</hi> whereof the Ministers ordinarilie are men of their moulding, looking more for preferment then caring for the soules; they feede them with some froathie Stuffe (as noble Prince Henrie well observed) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onelie much loosenes, but also perplexitie (for want of means) assault them. For as profuse giving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausteth the fountaine; so except the fountaine of Princelie liberalitie be ever sending some refreshing streams, to moisten the drinesse of their hott liverd ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they fall quicklie either unto a consumption; or else into a dropsie of indirect courses, which cannot but reflect upon their King and Mr. Now since his Majestie by reason of his maine imployments, cannot helpe them as he would (out of his owne meanes) with some of the Prelats needlesse &amp; hurtfull aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, he may supplie his servants wants, and doe much good with the rest.</p>
                  <p>But to go on, they sinne also against all his Majesties subjects;</p>
                  <p>And that first in tyrannising over their soules and bodies, in the courses of their unjust Courts. Which (as a noble man observeth) are <hi>opposite to all the Courts of the Kingdome, by reason of the exercise of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8853:70"/> sole authoritie. The Bishop citeth alone, accuseth alone, censureth and excommunicateth alone; But</hi> (saith he) <hi>Kings and Monarches have their Counsells. All temporall Courts have more wherein their authoritie doth rest; as the high Court of Parliament, Kings Bench, common Pleas, Chancery, Starchamber, and all the rest. And so it is in forraigne Kingdomes, witnesse the Parliaments in France: But the Prelate doth all himself, and that in matters of higher nature then the highest temporall affaires: which is a thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>past all example, and for which they can render no reason.</hi> That Popish tyranny indeed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they <hi>exalt themselves above all that is called God,</hi> is the very ground of it, and best reason they can render.</p>
                  <p>Out of their presumption, they dare crosse by their Courts, the highest Court of the Kingdome; namely the Parliament; for which sawsy courses, our Kings have secluded them the Court of Parliament. Instance <hi>Edward the first,</hi>

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1295</note> who called a Parliament of his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and commons, secluding the Clergie both from Parliament and protection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They sinne against the subjects, in bereaving them of their faithful sheepheards; in removing the <hi>Dogges</hi> that should keepe, &amp; the watchmen that should watch the <hi>Flockes:</hi> so they are left <hi>a prey to the Wolves</hi> &amp; <hi>Foxes,</hi> of which losse, implying danger; if the people were sensible, they would make more adoe then <hi>Michah</hi> made for his <hi>Idolatrous Levite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they are now as men forgotten, and their cause is so litle in request, that all the Ministers all most give way, <hi>yet with bowing downe betweene two burthens;</hi> what
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8853:70"/> a pressure of servitude they put upon honest and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers; their silent sorrowes and abrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints (for service put upon them fore against their hearts) doe testify. As for such in the Ministrie as are their devoted servants; they <hi>rejoyce in the flesh,</hi> by making the peoples burthens heavier.</p>
                  <p>The Prelats sett some as the <hi>Egyptian taske-Masters</hi> over the people, to see them doe their worke, wherein if the people faile, never so litle, with the <hi>Taskemasters they are punished.</hi> Our Ministers are used as the Romans used the <hi>Vestall Virgins;</hi> they are beaten if they keepe not in the <hi>Romish holy fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the peoples <hi>Zeale, sinceritie, holines, and labour of love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The smoke out of the bottomlesse pitt hath bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted them exceedinglie: For as the strict keeping of the first table, bindeth on the dueties of the second table, so remissenes or mixture in the first; maketh us loose in the dueties of the second. And if they yeild not to all, or be somewhat more strict in life and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, what a hurrying to their Courts, what a poleing of their purses, and what a poudering with their execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doe they keepe against them? which according to the Scripturs, Councells, and Fathers should onely be inflicted for <hi>Criminall causes.</hi> As the Apostle speaketh concerning an hereticke:<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:8853:71"/>
                  <p>They abuse also egregiouslie the writt <hi>de excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicato capiendo;</hi> which should runne onelie upon cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall causes, as <hi>heresie, denying to com at church, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, usurie, simonie, perjurie, Idolatrie.</hi> But for any of those, they neither cite nor censure Gods people (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have no grounds) and therefore they are not liable to this writt. Yet what case Gods people are in, by reason of this unjust proceeding, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to your honours.</p>
                  <p>To make up the full cup of affliction; by warrants and commitments from the <hi>high commission,</hi> people be cast into a blacke melancholike <hi>Golgatha</hi> or filthie prison, erected in the midle of the Citie, <hi>against the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the same.</hi> This is like the <hi>Lions denne,</hi> out of which verie few are delivered with their lives, except it be upon verie ill termes; witnesse the yet <hi>Crying blood of two honest men,</hi> within or about these three yeares, and a third had his deadlie wound, besides the death of others in the other prisons.

                  <p>It is a disgracefull affront to the Nobility, judges &amp; gentry, as though they were not worthy or fitt for the places. The like may be said of Ministers, being Iustices of peace.</p>
                  <p>That this their temporall jurisdiction is opposite to the law of God, it is manifest from these words: <hi>The Kings of the gentiles exercise Lordship over them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but ye shall not doe so.</hi> Luke 22.25.26.

                  <p>To draw to an end of ripping up this endlesse sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they sin more particularly against their <hi>Officers</hi> and Instruments, by whom they are served and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden; as <hi>Chancellours, Archdeacons, Officials, Churchwardens,</hi> &amp; <hi>Parish-Clerks;</hi> of all those, or of any one of them, is there any ground from Gods word, or insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from Christ? yea are they not all the <hi>Chips</hi> of that

                  <p>For further clearing of the evill condition of their Offices, give us leave to present you with a short view of the particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>Chancellours, Archdeacons,</hi> &amp; <hi>Officials,</hi> let us speake to them under the name of <hi>Officials;</hi> For they are all subordinate in evill offices to the Prelats: If the <hi>Officials</hi> place and case be naught, so must the superiour places and cases of such be, to whom, and which, they are deputed: now for the wofull condition of <hi>Officials,</hi> let them heare what <hi>Petrus Blecenses,</hi> a learned and devout man, (about the yeare 1150.) speaketh. In an Epistle to a certain <hi>Officiall,</hi> whom he desired to pull (as a <hi>brand out of the fire.</hi>) He writeth thus: <hi>Exeas Babilon, &amp; vr Chaldeorum;</hi> Get thee out (saith he) out of Babilon, or Vr of the Chaldeans, meaning his place. <hi>Ministerium enim est damnatissimae villicationis;</hi> It is an Office (saith he) of a most damnable stewardship. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum non est à nomine</hi> officii, <hi>sed à</hi> verbo <hi>officio;</hi> The
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8853:76"/> word (saith he) is not from the <hi>nown Officium,</hi> or a place of some usefull charge, but from <hi>Officio</hi> to <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</hi> And hence he maketh such verses as the time would afford, yea they may well serve; for the place is worse then the verses.</p>

                  <p>As for Chancellours they are the after-birth of the <hi>Prelats Lordship,</hi> wherein they have overtopt all other Earls and Barons, for none but Kings, Princes and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities have their Chancellours.</p>
                  <p>Further for Churchwardens, they sinne most against them, and cause them to sinne most of any of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8853:76"/> people, they make them the instrumēts of much sin. If they be wicked men thē it is their meat &amp; drinke, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare a faithfull Minister, &amp; to afflict Gods people; but if they be good men, they must either shift their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to shun that unlawfull and harmefull office to the undoing (it may be) of their calling and family; or they mustly in prison; or which is worst of all, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the office with a <hi>reluctancie in conscience,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved to Antichristian governours (howsoever they do no more hurt to Gods people.) We speake what we know; some of Gods people have felt heavie pangs of conscience for it upon their deathbeds. If the calling were of God, good men would hould it (being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called) rather an honour, then a burthen to their conscience, <hi>nam res bona neminem bonum scandaliz at,</hi> a good thing gives offence to no good men, but by the office they become in very deed the <hi>Counterfaits</hi> of Gods Officers, and the <hi>Popes promoters.</hi> They sweare and doe, they know not what, yea they infringe the laws of the Land, being made instruments to afflict Gods people: By serving of forraigne jurisdiction, they sin against the Kings Majesty. All these be more then manifest by their serving of the sinfull courses of the Prelacy, in all which they are instruments and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessoryes.</p>
                  <p>The greatnesse of their sin will appeare by a view of the particulars wherein they ferve, being directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same laws, which the Prelats transgresse.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, they sinne against the Parish Clerks, who are the right eye of their <hi>spitefull Courts,</hi> for their office what are they? (be it with reverence spokē) a very crew
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8853:77"/> of <hi>Holy water-dishclouts.</hi> There be (no doubt) honest men amongst them, and the more pittie they should serve sinne, but for the greater part, they are <hi>thorns in the eyes</hi> &amp; <hi>prickes in the sides</hi> of Gods Ministers &amp; good people: these be the <hi>Knights of the Crosse,</hi> the <hi>keepers of the Popes Wardrobe,</hi> the <hi>Lords of Misrule,</hi> and in a word, the <hi>great Maisters of the Revells,</hi> as for Pursuivants and Summoners, they make them nothing, but the <hi>servants of sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Prelats sinne also against all the <hi>wicked</hi> of the Land, of whose wickednesse and profanesse they are the very <hi>Tent</hi> &amp; <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and by opposing all good meanes, they strengthen the hands of the <hi>wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, they sinne against themselves, their owne soules &amp; consciences especially.</p>
                  <p>First, for wordly pompe and wealth, they enter upon an unlawfull call.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They cause others to sinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They bring the blood of many good men, and their families upon their heads.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They hazard (if not loose) all comfort in time of their greatest neede, when they come to give up their accompts?</p>
                  <p>Some dying like <hi>Naball</hi> (their hearts being dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are dead.) Some never casting about for any comfort; Some crying out, they have made a <hi>bad exchange.</hi>

                  <p>We could further relate what horrible plights they have putt good men into, upon their death beds, by forcing them to conforme, crying out that to save their means in their service, they had <hi>tipt</hi> their tōgus, or <hi>bittē</hi> Gods people, for which they smarted.

                  <p>To the first of these, let <hi>Iohannes Sarisburiensis</hi> answer: <hi>Nocent saepius, &amp; in eo daemones imitantur quod tunc prodesse putantur cum nocere desistunt,</hi> they hurt for the most part, but in this they gain the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of devills; they are thought to doe good when they cease to do evill.

                  <p>For the second, you know that maxime, <hi>aliud est esse &amp; aliud apparere;</hi> It is one thing to seem, and another thing to be.

                  <p>Henrie the 8. most admired the life of that subject, who never was <hi>so low</hi> as to be a <hi>Constable,</hi> nor never so high as to be a <hi>Iustice of peace,</hi> so we may say that he is the happiest <hi>Church-man, caeteris paribus,</hi> that never was so low, as to be a <hi>Parish-Clerk,</hi> nor came never so high as to be a <hi>Lord Bishop.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>If there were no more to prove this, but the former point well proved, it were enough; For if their <hi>calling</hi> &amp; <hi>standing</hi> be the cause of all the evill of our sinne &amp; judgment (as hath been proved) then no removall of them, no removall of sinne and judgment, but rather an increase of both. For it is the maine <hi>Nationall sinne</hi> that keepeth up and maintaineth the controversie with God, and if that ceasse not, God cannot in Iustice ceasse from <hi>punishing,</hi> till he have made an end.</p>
                  <p>The point then is made good from the former Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which still must be our <hi>medium</hi> or meane, for the proofe of this. Your Honours may be verie acute and sedulous in <hi>taking up</hi> &amp; <hi>redressing</hi> of state <hi>greivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> in repayring <hi>wronges,</hi> in censuring <hi>misdemeanours,</hi> in preventing the plotts of the <hi>Enimies,</hi> in searching out, and <hi>punishing</hi> our domesticke <hi>underminers,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding forces against the <hi>Enimie,</hi> for our selves and our <hi>Allies,</hi> in taking course with the <hi>mothes hornetts</hi> &amp; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars</hi> of the state.</p>
                  <p>All these are <hi>to be done,</hi> but the former is not <hi>to be left undone;</hi> For if all our owne <hi>greivances</hi> could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, and that which is Gods greatest greivance should not be done away, what good should be gott by

                  <p>Humanists relate how the Ancients had wont to hang a Wolves head upon the gates, to avoyd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the <hi>inchantment,</hi> or <hi>be witching</hi> of their Cities from contagious vapours, stirred up by inchanters. The truth of the evill, or remedie, we will not argue, but surely, the sprinkling of the blood of the Wolf, (if we can follow the Lord in it,) may be a means to save our King, and us, from these fearfull and imminent judgments, that he (for our sinnes) might have haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and halled upon us by his Iesuited tricks; as <hi>Masses, Murthers, Poysons, Treasons, Venerie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Venifices.</hi>

                  <p>Two things we desire to commend to your Honours, worthy your observation, the former is this:</p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:8853:91"/>
                  <p>When the Lord is compelled by the Magistrates neglect to take the matter of the execution of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, into his owne hand; in the midst of that mercie of <hi>easing</hi> him, and his people, of some of his <hi>adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> he setteth a <hi>Copie</hi> of his <hi>judgment,</hi> if Magistrats in their place follow not their Copie, the verie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the Lords enimies, thorow fear, or favour, or desire of ease, or hope of gain, becommeth the bane of the <hi>forbearers,</hi> for the just God ofttimes by som of those that they spare, and whom they should have pluckt up, plucketh them or theirs up without any pittie: for instances we need to go no further then the age wherein we live: Have not some of our <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentrie,</hi> yea some say, our <hi>late King</hi> perished by such, as they should not have <hi>spared,</hi> the Lord made this good in former times against his owne people. The Lord telleth them in the 2. of the Iudges, that <hi>he would not break covenant with them,</hi> but they must alsoo looke to keep covenant with him in this very particular, that we have in hand, <hi>you shall make no league with the inhabitants of the Land; you shall throw downe their Altars, but ye have not obeyed, why have ye done this? Wherefore I also said: I will not drive them out from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, but they shall be as thorns in your sides,</hi>

                     <hi>and their Gods shall be a snare unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The gunpowder-plotters were cōsumed by a <hi>fire</hi> of their own making, intimating to us, that we should have ferrited out, and fiered out (namely by due course of law) the rest of that fiery crew, and all their strange <hi>fire;</hi> that we should have broken all their <hi>Altars</hi> &amp; <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> into <hi>chalk stones,</hi> that we should have pluckt up <hi>root</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:8853:92"/> and <hi>branch;</hi> destroyed <hi>head,</hi> and taile; swept all away and made a clean <hi>howse:</hi> but we did not, nor have not yet <hi>obeyed,</hi> and will not the Lord say to us: <hi>why have ye done this?</hi> Yes, he hath us in question, and hath made good the threatening upon us; For now they are so farre from being <hi>driven out,</hi> that they are like to drive us and ours out; yea they and their agents, the <hi>Arminians</hi> so <hi>gall</hi> our <hi>sides,</hi> and <hi>greive</hi> our <hi>soules,</hi> that we know not how to bestow our selves; yea we have all cause with that people forenamed to <hi>lift up our voyce, and weep,</hi> till we can weep no more.</p>
                  <p>Another instance may be taken from that <hi>deadly blowe,</hi> givē by Gods owne <hi>hand,</hi> to Balaams <hi>Priest,</hi> and his Idolatrous auditorie, in the Black-Friers of <hi>London;</hi> where he caused the ruins of an howse, to cover and revenge that Idolatrie in blood, and rubbish, which polluted the <hi>Sabbath, outstared</hi> the <hi>Heavens</hi> holy due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yea affronted <hi>God</hi> himself, without controulment of any man; As this was the verie extraordinarie <hi>fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of God, laying his enimies in the dust: so it poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the duetie of <hi>Ministers</hi> &amp; <hi>Magistrats,</hi> that they should have followed the <hi>blowe, doing execution</hi> with the word, and with the sword: But as the execution of this Iudgment wrought nothing on the Papists, but <hi>fretting, desire,</hi> &amp; <hi>threatening</hi> of <hi>revēge</hi> on Gods people; with a peremptorie resolution, to manage out Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with a higher hand; so it wrought nothing on us, but a <hi>gazing stupiditie</hi> for the time; for what man of place hath conceived, what the Lord said to him in that execution; or hath followed home the Lord in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8853:92"/> his work, by putting to his hand, to shake any <hi>Piller of Popery?</hi> yea have not for the ruine of one howsefull many howsefulls (yea townfulls) risen up since that time? whom God in judgment may suffer to shake our <hi>Churches</hi> &amp; <hi>howses,</hi> because we would not <hi>learn</hi> (when God was readie to <hi>guide our hand</hi>) to write by a <hi>President.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is further worth the noteing, that as the French alloted them an <hi>howse</hi> to that dismall work, contrarie to the Law of God &amp; Nations, &amp; was never called to an accōpt for the dishonour done to God, the undoing of souls, &amp; the losse of the Kings subjects; So the <hi>French</hi> hath plagued &amp; pestered us since worse then before, &amp; that both in our <hi>states</hi> &amp; <hi>religion;</hi> For by that <hi>unequall match</hi> (which we lay not to heart as we should) they have set up <hi>Baalpeor</hi> in publick amōgst us, by the which especially,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>we provoking God to anger the plague of the Lord brake in upon us;</hi> which though it be removed, yet if we remove not that <hi>plague</hi> of the <hi>Masse,</hi> the wrath of the Lord will never leave us, till it hath quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed us.</p>
                  <p>Let the last instance be from the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> being the main subject of our treatise. It is cleared that all our evills of sinne and judgment are from them, and butte full upon them; and therefore the Lord hath mett with many of thē in <hi>remarkable judgment,</hi> shewing them &amp; their places to be the <hi>gangreen</hi> of the Land; yet for all this, what man of note or place hath lent the Lord an hand, to the casting downe of their strong houlds?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8853:93"/> and notwithstanding that men now with half an eye can see, and say, that their standing (meaning their places) must be the <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>nation,</hi> yet the <hi>prophane favour them,</hi> and the <hi>Professor feareth them;</hi> so that there is not a man of any place to come forth, and say; <hi>Come and see how zealous I will be for the Kingdome of Christ, against those his enemies, that will not have him to raigne over them;</hi> which is a shrewd evidence, if we gett no better heart to the businesse, that they shall plague us and ours <hi>seaven times more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude the point, it is a great fault in men of place, both Ministers and Magistrats, that they would have God to doe all the <hi>hard worke</hi> by himself, and they would come, and gather up the <hi>spoyle:</hi> but they who will raigne with God, even in the glory of any <hi>good work,</hi> must <hi>do for him,</hi> and suffer <hi>with him</hi> in the doing of the <hi>Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The later main remarkeable thing is this: That all the things that we have looked for, effected, and relyed upon, hath proved to us as broken reeds.</p>
                  <p>For the better clearing of this observation we will first give some instances of it, and then shew the grounds, and lastly the use of it.</p>
                  <p>To begin with our expectation and issue: after the death of Queen Elizabeth, all the good, had great hopes of a <hi>conformitie</hi> of Church-government to the rule of <hi>Christ;</hi> a great many Ministers and people sett
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8853:93"/> themselves to maintaine, and sollicite the cause of Christ. But the subtile <hi>Tempter,</hi> namely the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> did so winde it self, like the <hi>ivie</hi> about the vine, that they drained out all his spirit of <hi>reformation,</hi> (if he brought any with him,) yea they suggested to the eye of his apprehension, such a bewitching <hi>Phantasm</hi> of <hi>pleasure, profit, honour, applause, admiration, absolute government,</hi> &amp; <hi>absolute libertie,</hi> to do what he list; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the maintenance of an <hi>Honourable Clergie;</hi> that he conceived them to be the bravest <hi>Ornaments,</hi> and fittest Instruments for <hi>King craft,</hi> that were in the world.</p>
                  <p>Again, they filled his eares with forged reproches of the government of Christ, taking opportunitie, to strike upon that <hi>Iarring string</hi> of his sometimes exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated conceit.</p>
                  <p>They further buzzed into his eares the danger of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperating Papists, if he should comply with <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, they so plyed his deluded disposition with evill Instruments, and <hi>mercenarie men,</hi> that he must <hi>hear</hi> nothing, nor <hi>bear</hi> nothing, but the <hi>wilde grapes of Episcopall conformitie;</hi> Whereupon they grew so inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that they added <hi>violence</hi> to their <hi>malice,</hi> abusing the King; in that (besides his pleasure and command) they tooke away the <hi>sheepheards,</hi> &amp; <hi>scattered the flocks,</hi> and so to our great greife we were disappointed of this point of our expectation.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:8853:94"/>
                  <p>An other ground of our hope was that magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious <hi>Henrie</hi> (whom we do not name to <hi>minorate</hi> the parts of our present Soveraigne) whose Heroick parts and Princely cariage, were not only a <hi>terror</hi> &amp; <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to forrains, but they were also both feared and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed by <hi>Papists,</hi> &amp; <hi>Prelats,</hi> whom he could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. But our <hi>sinnes,</hi> and our <hi>enimies</hi> malice, caused the <hi>Summer sett</hi> upon our <hi>faire Rose</hi> before we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, and so that <hi>Anchor came home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third thing we looked for, was the removall of the former <hi>Favorite,</hi> which the Lord effected: But in stead of a <hi>Thistle</hi> he fitt us with a <hi>bramble,</hi> because we were no better worthie.</p>
                  <p>A fourth thing that we much importuned God for, was the breaking of the <hi>Spanish match,</hi> and our Princes safe returne from Spaine: God in mercie graunted both, but we were so unthankfull for both these in a right manner, and brake up our watching over him for a better <hi>helper,</hi> that God suffered him, to our <hi>heavie woe,</hi> to match with <hi>the Daughter of Heth,</hi> though he mist an <hi>Aegyptian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When all things were so farre out of frame, that we are becom the prey of our enimies, the mockerie of our freinds, a shame to our selves, and the fotestoole of a <hi>favourite:</hi> then nothing but a Parliament, Oh! a Parliament would mend all; But Parliament we had after Parliament, and what was amended? Your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> can best tell who departed the howse (at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation) in so heavie a moode, as though ye had been led captive by some conquerour of the state; For that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8853:94"/> overswaying <hi>evill</hi> (on whom all reformation tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) caried all opposition with so strong a hand, that he &amp; his (the basest of whom durst brave the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) were thought too hard for the state: But him also hath God cutt off, and what would we have more? Surely, we <hi>may looke for good, but evill shall come out from the presence of the Lord,</hi> till we hit the right vein, as our services are like cloudes, without raine, so the Lords favours will prove to us as the morning dew.</p>
                  <p>But what is the ground of all this failing of our <hi>Hopes?</hi> Even the suffering of this <hi>cursed ground</hi> of the <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> to bring forth so many <hi>brambles:</hi> (under favour,) if ye had begun at this ground, your work in all reason had gone better with you. Therefore to the use, which is the last particular of this point: <hi>arise now, and do it:</hi> The right way to the work of reformation, is to begin with the <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> as Ezechia &amp; Iosia did: the <hi>inner Court</hi> of Christs Temple is first to be measured, before the outward Court of <hi>Policy.</hi> Give us leave to inforce the duety from some motives, besides the reasons, rising from the Positions, we will contrive the reasons as breifely as may be.</p>
                  <p>The first reason may be taken from the evill, which you are to deal with; namely, such a <hi>burthen</hi> as the Lord can not any longer bear, but you must either ease him of it, or he will <hi>ease</hi> the Land of such as are in <hi>place,</hi> and will do nothing for him. If any object that Bs. be not so evill; there be many good men amongst them: we answer, (as hath been said,) that we take not upon us to determine of their persons; for many are willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves with this sophisme: <hi>he is a good man.</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:8853:95"/> Ergo a <hi>good Lord Bishop,</hi> as though <hi>goodnesse</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> being both in one subject were <hi>convertible terms,</hi> where it should rather follow, <hi>he is a Lord Bishop,</hi> Ergo <hi>no good man;</hi> because it is verie hard to be a <hi>good man in a bad calling,</hi> instance in a <hi>player,</hi> or the like. But for their good we will say no more; but let their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practise speake in these two particulars; namelie their hatred and crueltie against Gods Ministers and people, and their blasphemous scoffing at the <hi>Language of Canaan,</hi> or Scripture Phrase; as if a man shall name the <hi>Seal of his Ministrie; glorifying of God; sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lords day; or walking with God,</hi> they will houpe and hout at a man, as though he were a <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> to them.</p>

                     <hi>Parliamentum habet in se potestatem totius Regni, imò capitis &amp; corporis:</hi> The Parliament hath in it the power of the whole Kingdome, yea both of the head and of the body: Then power must be put in use, or it looseth the <hi>power.</hi> You are the <hi>Elders of Israell;</hi> you are an <hi>armie of Generals;</hi> that supream Court, that may call any place, or person to an account, whether they be for the glorie of God, the good of the King and State, or no; you are the <hi>Physitians</hi> of State; up and doe your cure; In a word, it were happie for our King and us, if you knew your power <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie.</hi> They are the devise of man, contrarie to Gods commandment, and man must remove them.</p>

A third reason is from that precious pledge, that they keep (as it were) incarcerated to their will (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Kings Majestie,) for where they beare sway, there the King (as <hi>Woolsey</hi> wrote) is <hi>their King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have shewed, how they have vexed Kings to the verie death. But is not the King <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Consider then what a pittie it is to all, and an <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leble</hi> dishonour it will be to you, the state representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that so <hi>ingenuous</hi> &amp; <hi>tractable</hi> a King should be so monstrously abused by <hi>the bane of Princes,</hi> to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of himself, &amp; his subjects.</p>
                  <p>It was truely said of a wise <hi>Polititian:</hi>

                     <hi>and there shall come forth a Vessell for the finer, take away the wicked frō before the King and his Throne shall be established in his righteousnesse.</hi> But we mean to presse this particular a litle further, when we come to speake of the means.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth reason is, from Gods offering of himself, to guide you by the hand, (as we have shewed;) who by giving of the first blow hath in mercie removed the greatest <hi>nayl</hi> in all their <hi>tent, and will not you follow home?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fift reason is from our not-profiting by any mercie, <hi>privative,</hi> or <hi>positive,</hi> that God hath afforded us: we doe not thrive or gaine by any thing, and where lyes the fault? even in this, as we have shewed, in that we lay not the axe to the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>right tree:</hi> We do not undermine that which undermineth us: We fight not against that which fighteth against <hi>Christ.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to use the word of the Psalmist, <hi>be wise</hi> at length <hi>great Senatours,</hi> and in the feare of the Lord <hi>break the bands</hi> of these that are like to break us in peeces. What good shall we gett by removall of that <hi>pocks of the state,</hi> if the radicated humor in the <hi>evill liver of Rome</hi> be not followed with the power of eradicating <hi>Minerals.</hi> To move the humor, and not <hi>to remove it, is to double the strength of the disease.</hi> As we have alreadie given some instances of this; so we feare from this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the proofe of wofull experience. The Lord
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8853:96"/> hath broake the enimies <hi>Limbeck.</hi> Even no doubt when some <hi>spirit of mischeife</hi> was come to the verie <hi>helm,</hi> so that he hath marred the Devils labour, even when he was to be delivered of some <hi>monstrous</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife to the state. But (notwithstanding all this as hath been said) if we thinke the <hi>Vessell</hi> to be quite broake, and their <hi>Oyl</hi> &amp; <hi>Paines,</hi> and all lost, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ourselves exceedinglie; for the <hi>menstruous</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the body of the work remains in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: if you give them leave thorow delay, but to lute on a new <hi>neck,</hi> they will show you a new <hi>Spirit,</hi> in an ould work, and if you stand not up in the <hi>breach,</hi> for a furnace of <hi>brick,</hi> they will make one of <hi>marble,</hi> and for a <hi>neck</hi> of <hi>glasse,</hi> they will make one of <hi>steel,</hi> so that the last <hi>wo</hi> will prove worse then the first, and the daye of his <hi>death</hi> shall bring forth more bitternesse then the day of his <hi>life:</hi> For know this for a certaintie that <hi>Rome, Spaine, France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Austria;</hi> the Prelats, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, and all the <hi>crackling Thorns,</hi> &amp; <hi>fire-work men</hi> in the former work will sett all they have, and themselves to upon a <hi>rest,</hi> rather then they will not make good the wicked work they have begun.

                  <p n="6">6. The sixt reason is from the present evill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein we stand, and the danger whereunto we are lyable.</p>
                  <p>First for our state, as the Physitian said of nature, that it <hi>was but all one sicknes,</hi> so our state indeed is but all <hi>one
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8853:97"/> distemper;</hi> Or with the Prophet: <hi>There is nothing sound from the Crowne of the head, to the sole of the foot, the heart is sick, &amp; the head is heavie;</hi> yea our consciences are more dominiered over within, &amp; our state more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by forrains without, then any free nation profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Gospell in the world, and for our religion and worship of God, it is so overlaid with the <hi>rubbish</hi> of <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and <hi>superstition</hi> that the <hi>sacrifice</hi> in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is mixed with <hi>tears,</hi> and <hi>groans;</hi> and if it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, they will raze the verie foundations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; For they have <hi>shooke</hi> them shrewdlie alreadie by their Popish and Arminian tenēts and practises. As for Iugdments, besides these alreadie seased, if <hi>we return not,</hi> as the Lord threateneth by his Prophet: <hi>He will cutt off head,</hi>

A seaventh motive, to prevaile with you, may be taken from your owne particular; it is said in that forequoted place of <hi>Esai,</hi> that the <hi>Ancient and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is that head,</hi> which the Lord will <hi>cutt off.</hi> You are the <hi>Elders of Israell,</hi> the <hi>Ancient</hi> &amp; <hi>Honourable,</hi> whom the Lord will cutt off by them, if you <hi>cutt</hi> not them <hi>off.</hi> We have shewed and proved how they have struck at root, and branch of the <hi>Ancients of England,</hi> and how they have caused many to fall. You and yours (if you be right) they aym at. How dishonourable &amp; basely have they dealt with the Nobilitie, &amp; Gentrie, striking soms hats from their heads, threatening o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, making some Daunce their attendance.</p>
                  <p>The Iesuite needeth, neither the force of <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor <hi>Austria,</hi> nor <hi>Italie,</hi> to the ruining of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Arminianised,</hi> or right down <hi>Popish Prelate,</hi> the bellie-serving Machivell, the state-betraying <hi>Papist</hi> wil make it readie meat for his mouth.</p>
                  <p>From this <hi>self vndermining</hi> course the wisest of the Counsell of Spaine have prevailed with the rest, to take this for a <hi>principall;</hi> not to assayle our nation, till by <hi>home-bred sedition</hi> and disorder of Church &amp; State, it be readie to fall in their mouth, &amp; so they may have it cheap enough. In the mean time your state &amp; families shall be but a prey to the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and to such as the <hi>Prelacy</hi> do support; For all the <hi>overturners</hi> of the Kingdome turneth upon the <hi>hinges</hi> of the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the storm may overblow the poorer <hi>shrubs,</hi> when we and our <hi>Cedar-like families</hi> may be blowen up by the

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prelates will not prey on fleeslesse sheep. Remove then this <hi>deadly cup,</hi> or your portion of it one day may make you cry out: <hi>O! how bitter it is!</hi>

The eight motive riseth from the generall desire of all the well affected; yea the meerly civill longeth for their downfall: <hi>Sions Plea</hi> against them hath ever been maintained, since the beginning of reformation; witnesse both the doings &amp; the sufferings of the Saints in that behalf, but now their tyrannie, &amp; treacherie in betraying of the trueth, to Poperie and Arminianisme, together with the prophanesse of them and theirs, unvaileth more fully to men of all ranks, (as Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Magistracie, Ministerie, Gentrie, and Cominaltie,) the iniquitie of their <hi>place,</hi> and the ruine thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueing, which maketh them cry with one voyce, <hi>downe with the Babell of Prelacy;</hi> For the which they may justly alledge that reason, that the Philistine Princes alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against David; that he should not go to battle with them, <hi>least he be</hi> (say they) <hi>an adversarie to us, for wherwith should he reconcile himself unto his Master? should it not be with the heads of these mē?</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 29.4.

                  <p n="9">9.

                  <p>For the further illustration, they apply that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the Gospell,<note place="margin">

                  <p>We would have men to consider why they broach this untruth, and would have others to maintaine it; namely that they may <hi>dung</hi> and dresse, and still bear out that bitter <hi>root,</hi> &amp; rotten <hi>stump</hi> of their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian government; the denyall of good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Christ his howse maketh way for all the bad government of the Beast, and such is the Hierarchicall government, which hath as much to doe with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Masse</hi> hath with the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> It hath none of the causes, or concurring parts, that maketh up the definition of Discipline.</p>

                  <p>It is just so with us; for how may good motions of reformation, in sundry of our Kings, have miscaried, thorow feares arising from the <hi>perfidie,</hi> &amp; <hi>rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> we have partlie shewed, and might further enlarge our selves, but that your Honours know them well enough.</p>
                  <p>Vndermining <hi>Prelates,</hi> and dominiering <hi>Favorites,</hi> have cast our bravest Kings into many cold sweats.</p>
                  <p>Henrie the 3. as wise and well governing a Prince as any we had, after that he was rid of evill <hi>spirits;</hi> being in danger of drowning upon <hi>Thames,</hi> he was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what transported with feare; and being come on shoare; Mountford bad him be of good cheer, now the danger was past: The King replyed, that he was more afrayd of him, then of drowning, or any other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and of all the feares, and cares, &amp; desperate straits, of this King, who were the prime cause, but the proude Prelates?</p>
                  <p>Yea a Tragicall instance of our late <hi>King</hi> might serve for proofe enough, if there were no more. If ever Prince deserved the name of the <hi>Bishops King,</hi> and <hi>Father of favorites,</hi> that did he; but how was he requited of both? Surely for the reverence that we owe to Kings, we are ashamed to say how grosly they abused him, in life and in death; yea he found himself
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8853:114"/> so deluded to his face, and (all things going head long to wrack) that he groaned in his sowle to be rid of his burthen; and if he had had as <hi>mettle men</hi> about him, (as some times he had, who would have <hi>broke</hi> the <hi>snare</hi> and delivered his <hi>sowle</hi>) we should have seene that he would have owned the fact, and thanked them too.</p>
                  <p>Yea with greefe in heart, to come to the verie dayes wherein we now live: Have not the Prelates, &amp; their late <hi>Champiō</hi> so <hi>hedged</hi> in our now Soveraigne, that he could scarse looke but at their appointment; to the no small dishonour of his Majestie, the undoing of the State, and the wounding of the hearts of all his loyall and loving subjects.</p>
                  <p>Hence you see, great <hi>Senators,</hi> what need Kings have of such a Counsell of State, as will deliver their <hi>sowles</hi> from the <hi>snare of the Hunter.</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8853:115"/> in Religion, King, and State: Let flatterers, and enemies to King, State, &amp; Religion, say what they will, you must be to them, that which <hi>Antigonus</hi> said of <hi>Zeno,</hi> the great Philosopher: <hi>Gestorum Regis Theatrum:</hi> The verie <hi>Theater</hi> of the Kings actions: Or as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher sayth of the hand: It is the <hi>Instrument of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</hi> So must you be <hi>eyes, ad discernenda Regis pericula,</hi> to discern the present danger of the King, and hands to him and us, to deliver all out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The ancients give for an <hi>Hierogliph</hi> of a wise <hi>Senate,</hi> and able <hi>Counsell,</hi> a litle <hi>fish</hi> going before the great <hi>whale,</hi> discovering shallowes and other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and shewing the way by the motion of it self.

                  <p>This course have stout and wise Counsellers taken for the deliveries both of Kings and States, as we may read ad large, both in sacred and prophane Histories.</p>
                  <p>The Counsell of State delivered <hi>Ioash</hi> from the blooddy tyrannie of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> Gods worship from Idolatrie, and the Kingdome from destruction; where if any object that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was an usurper, and that <hi>Ioash</hi> was kept besides the Crowne; we answer, it is as great a mischeife to a State (if not greater) for a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8853:115"/> good King to be manacled &amp; swayed by the wicked in his throne, as to be besides his throne. As it is an evidēt token of Gods wrath, to be without <hi>Counsell;</hi> as the Spirit witnesseth of his owne people: <hi>A nation voyd of Counsels,</hi> Deut. 32.28. that is, never a whit of Counsell at all amongst them; so <hi>wicked Counsellers</hi> (as the same Spirit speaketh) are the very <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Deceit,</hi> Proverb. 12.5. to carie Kings and Kingdomes headlong to destruction.</p>
                  <p>We read of <hi>Vzziah</hi> his proud attempt, whose heart being lifted up with prosperitie, and forgetting that God had <hi>wrought all his works for him,</hi> he will <hi>burn incense upon the Altar</hi> of the Lord. But Azariah, and the <hi>valiant men of the Lord,</hi> withstood him, shewing from the Law, that it <hi>pertayned not to him,</hi> 2. Chron. 26.11.17. &amp;c. Yea though he was <hi>wroath,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he might thinke his good intent might cary him out, yet they would not suffer him V. 19.</p>
                  <p>Why then should ye, <hi>great Counsell of State,</hi> and our <hi>valiant men of God,</hi> suffer the <hi>Ministers of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ?</hi> to offer <hi>strange fire</hi> on the Altar of the Lord, which will cause the fire of Gods indignation, (if it be not removed,) to consume us all.</p>

                     <hi>what do these Hebrews here?</hi> The King apologied Davids fidelitie to the Princes, from that good and faithfull deportment, that he had found in him ever, since the time of his being with him: but with this the Princes were not satisfied, but were wroth, saying to the King: <hi>send this fellow back to his place, &amp;c.</hi> They render a reason; that he would be <hi>an adversarie to them; for where with should he obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Master? should it not be with the heads of these men?</hi>

Scaliger Pag. <hi>263.</hi> Proditor Episcopus.</note> sent a privie Messenger to the Turk, showing him what strait they were in, and that he might have the place as cheap as he could desire it. By this meanes the Citie was betrayed; wherefore the Author blaseth him in the margine of the Historie for the <hi>Traytor Bishop.</hi> But this is but a pettie matter to that which some of our owne have done, who have betrayed whole Kingdomes, besides their stirring up the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to rebellion.</p>

                  <p>Besides the foresaid instances from Scripture, what abundance of examples have we in humain Histories of grave Counsels prevailing with their Princes, to the great good of King and State.</p>
                  <p>It is written of <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that he debated with his Counsell a businesse of great weight, so that he would have it according to his <hi>will:</hi> But <hi>Scaevola</hi> the great Lawyer, and faithfull Counseller, with others of the like fidelitie, would have it according to his <hi>weale,</hi> and so indeed they caried it: <hi>I see Masters</hi> (quoth the Emperour) <hi>it must be as you will have it.</hi>

                  <p>The like is related of <hi>Lewes</hi> the XII. of France, who thanked his Counsell much for their faithfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant resolution.</p>
                  <p>But to go no further, have not your Ancestours both kept sundry Kings, for a great while out of the pitt of destruction, and pulled some <hi>as Brands out of the fire?</hi> Instāce, <hi>Henrie</hi> the III. whose historie you know, who after that he <hi>came to himself</hi> was as good a King as the best.

                  </p>

                  <p>Give us leave to speake: Ye know how ye went away at the last rising, hanging downe your heads, yea some with tears in your eyes, (as though) ye had been led in Triumph after the Dukes Chariot: and what a deal of Triumph and tantost was there in the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles</hi> of the wicked?</p>
                  <p>It grieved the sowles of some, to see the Kings pale lookes, and heavie countenance, howsoever the <hi>litle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good</hi> Prelate, and his faction, were alwayes prompting with an <hi>omnia bene,</hi> or <hi>ha, ha, so would we have it:</hi> But God hath broke the <hi>Base,</hi> break you the <hi>Treble;</hi> or the <hi>trouble</hi> of the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> &amp; then the black <hi>Sanctos</hi> of their Musick is marred: But if you suffer still these grand enemies of State, with their confederate favorites, to turne our <hi>silver into drosse, and our wine into water;</hi> all

                  <p>But more of this when we come to the meanes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We come in the next place to the second point of proof; namely the practize of nations, or the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of all reformed Churches. Approvable practise, especially of Gods people, in a thing of high, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie nature, is both a good warrant and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8853:119"/> to others in the like case. Yea it serveth to condemne them, if they do not follow.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the <hi>Vnited Provinces,</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> the II. of Spaine, contrarie to the nature of a King; the Counsell, &amp; intreatie of his Father, his owne solemne oath, &amp; covenant, made at his entrie, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in his heart, by the instigation and evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the <hi>Duke de Alva,</hi> to make slaves of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers;</hi> Cardinall Granvell, and the black Counsell of <hi>Hell</hi> devised for the effecting of this, and for to adde to their burthens, the bringing in of 15. new <hi>Bishops,</hi> together with the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> both which the Duke de Alva established, to the spoyling of their goods, the tormenting of their bodyes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of their sowles; the prisons were so full, they were forced to erect more, upon which cruell courses 100000. families left their places, and meanes, to save their lives, by living other where, but by this <hi>fierie triall</hi> the Lord did not onely purge the <hi>drossie,</hi> and heavie disposition of that <hi>people,</hi> and made them more weeldie for <hi>Armes;</hi> but he also thereby made the scales to fall from their eyes, that in the midst of the fornace, they saw the light of the Gospell, which with all those dangers they imbraced and maintained with their blood, they gathered themselves into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, as in Zealand there were 60. companies: they built Churches, which the cruell <hi>Duke</hi> demolished, and in their place set up Gallowes, executing all that could be found.</p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:8853:120"/>
                  <p>Yet for all this they went on, till thorow Gods mercie, and the assistance of neighbouring Princes (both with their purses, and the blood of their subjects) they grew to an united body; and having broake the bands both of Spanish and Popish tyrannie, they tooke away the <hi>drosse</hi> of that <hi>overlaying,</hi> &amp; <hi>tyrannizing Prelacie,</hi> as the grownd of all their wo, and as the onely way to establish the puritie of Christs ordinances.</p>
                  <p>They cashiered the Bishops of <hi>Vtrick,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Haerlem</hi> in Holland. The Bishop of <hi>Midlebourgh</hi> in Zealand. The Bishops of <hi>Lewardin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Groening</hi> in Frizeland. The Bishop of <hi>Deventer</hi> in Overyssell, after which they prospered exceedingly against the enemies, for this is the way indeed; <hi>to catch the ould one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this had not been a good course, or if any thing would have served but this, then notwithstanding of their resisting of the Spanish tyrannie, they might and should have kept these <hi>Holy Fathers, the Prelates,</hi> as their <hi>cheife builders</hi> of the howse of God: But God taught them, and heavie experience cleared this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall; that there is no building of <hi>Gods howse,</hi> after his owne Patern, so long as the <hi>Pillers</hi> of Antichrist beare swaye in the howse, there is no shutting of the dore, whilst the thief is in the howse: so long as they had kept <hi>possession, Spaine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome</hi> could never fullie have lost their <hi>possession,</hi> and therefore they tooke the right course, both for <hi>reformation,</hi> &amp; <hi>libertie,</hi> to shutte them quite out at dores; neither did ever any true
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:8853:120"/> friend to the Gospell to this day condemne them; not the King of France, being a Papist, nor his brother, <hi>Duke de Angue,</hi> their governour, though also a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this their deliverie from Spaine, and Rome, they gave this devise to their armes; a coller about the Lions neck, with this <hi>word: Rosis Leonem, lorris mus liberat:</hi> The bands being broken, the mouse setteth free the Lion. And on the other side against it, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> with this devise: <hi>Liber Leo, revinciri pernegat:</hi> The Lion being once free, will not againe be bound.</p>
                  <p>The summe of all that hath been said,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Meteren. Pag.</hi> 43. 45 49. 91. 305.</note> concerning this particular, be pleased to see in the Historie of the Netherlands. Onely give us leave to apply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises.</p>
                  <p>Our Prelates keep not onely the <hi>Lion,</hi> our <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> in bands, but even the <hi>Lion</hi> of the <hi>tribe of Iudah;</hi> and as the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaniard</hi> counted no more of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick forces,</hi> and their confederate helps, then of so many <hi>mice;</hi> even so the proud <hi>Prelates</hi> partly thorow their owne ambition; and partly thorow the carelesnesse, or feare, or part taking of others, are growen with all their rable, so to outbrave the Parliament; that they count no more of them then so many <hi>mice:</hi> they are growen so pack now with the <hi>scare crow-censures</hi> of the State, (for they count them no better,) that they are no more afrayd of that terrible <hi>Tribunall,</hi> then
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:8853:121"/> the <hi>frogs</hi> were of the log, that Iupiter is feigned to let fall amongst them: Yea as the Hungarian goeth not ordinarily with his weapon, nor is not reputed a brave Gentleman, till he have killed a <hi>Turk,</hi> so among that crew, he is not a fellow <hi>in grain,</hi> till he have braved the Parliament: But let them know whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride; and as the Belgick <hi>mices teeth,</hi> or rather the noble <hi>Brittans blades</hi> freed this Lion (though now too forgetfull of his deliverer;) so cut you the <hi>cords</hi> (for that is better then to unloose them) set free the <hi>Lion</hi> of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and you shall be more precious to God, and better metall to the state, then the gould whereof the Philistims mice were made, which they sent home in the Ark. Yea your <hi>devise</hi> shall be <hi>this,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously glorious to all the world, ingravē in goulden <hi>Characters,</hi> about the neck of <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Church. Hic Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus est medicus huius Leonis:</hi> This Parliament hath cured this Lion of the Kings evill.</p>
                  <p>A second instance of practise may be taken from the <hi>North-Britans</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> our neighbour nation; who did vendicate the libertie of the Church, and State, to so high an alay, that in everie particular it was without paralell: so that the last King gave this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of it, that it was as pure a Church (if not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer) as any, since the time of Christ; and therefore he thanked God, that it was his lott to live in it; and how came they to the excellencie of that puritie? but by <hi>taking away the drosse,</hi> namely the <hi>Prelacie</hi> with all the train of the trumperie; so that they left not one
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8853:121"/>
                     <hi>Hoofe</hi> of the Beast. But who did this? even the Counsell of State? but by what authoritie, <hi>command,</hi> or concurrence from the supream Magistrate? Surely by none at all, but rather against the stern and cruell opposition of <hi>three Popish Princes,</hi> all raigning over them with an high hand; namely, <hi>Francis,</hi> &amp; <hi>Marie,</hi> King, &amp; Queen of <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; Queen <hi>Mother</hi> Regent for the time, Sister to the house of Guise. These <hi>three Princes</hi> were devoted sowle and body to the Pope, &amp; the two women were as resolute and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick for atchieving of their malicious ends, as any of their <hi>Sex.</hi> Besides they had all the power and Counsell of these howse of Guise, (who swayed all France) to further their attempts. They sent great forces into <hi>Scotlād,</hi> with a number of the fiercest spirits, shrewdest pates, and best soldiers, that were amongst them; that with fire and sword they might destroy those reformers, with their posteritie, and root out the Gospell. We will trouble you but with one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Labrosse,</hi> a great Counseller, &amp; Soldier, thought it was fittest to destroy all the nobilitie, and to billet some thousands of the French Horse upon their meanes; and as for the cominaltie to make vassals and slaves of them: his letters directed into France to this purpose were intercepted, which stirred up the state to stand for reformation, as much as for their lives. To these fierce designes the Bishops were <hi>Fyre</hi> &amp; <hi>Bellows;</hi> witnesse, one of them in these blooddie
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8853:122"/> broyls,<note place="margin">Ep. Ambian. Buchan. rer. Scotio. lib. <hi>10.</hi> p. <hi>174.</hi>
                     </note> who railed and cursed the Soldiers, because they did not burne, rob, slay, and ravish all right downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Especiallie he was vexed, that they did not murther one <hi>William Matlan,</hi> a brave Gentleman, and so good a Scholler, that he was to hard for all the learning of <hi>Sorbon:</hi> Therefore the Bishop would have the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to cut his throat, and that should be an <hi>unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable argument:</hi> but the Lord quenched all their fiery darts, and so strengthened the hearts, and guided the hands of the state; with the assistance of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, that they prevayled mightily against their, and Gods enemies, and never gave over the work, till they layd (as one said) the verie <hi>Coapstone of reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that our English <hi>Euroclydon,</hi> or sulphurious South-burning winde of Babel, together with some rotten <hi>Meteors</hi> of inclosed vapours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, have like an earthquake shaken the howse, and uncovered the roof of it: but let us looke to it; we are the unwholesome <hi>point,</hi> from whence this <hi>infecting winde</hi> hath blowen upon them; for if we doe not, it is like not onely to splitt our Ship upon the rock, but also to rent the veyle of <hi>three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We could relate at large more instances, as the <hi>French, Switzers, Bohemians, Germanes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Geneva,</hi>) who presently upon their reformation removed this ground of <hi>deformation,</hi>) but the truth is so well knowne, we should but take up time; onely observe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8853:122"/> this point of reformation, observed by the <hi>Biscayns</hi> to this day, as some write: this being a Province of Spaines Dominions, the people can not endure a Lord Bishop to tread upon their ground; witnesse, that <hi>tryall</hi> that Ferdinand the Catholike made, by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a Bishop with him, guarding him in the midle of all his great trayn; but the people not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him, the King sent him presently out of their territories, and they digged up the ground, whereon the Bishops Mule stood, and cast it into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>I recite this the rather, because it is cited by that geybing <hi>Geographer,</hi> who telleth the Puritanes;<note place="margin">Helen.</note> that that were a fine place for them to dwell in; but there is a better way then that, root such Bishops out of England, and it will be a finer place for the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans to dwell in, and let the Bishops and their favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites go make their peace with <hi>Biscay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude the point, you see (right Honourable) what other States have done for the deliverance of them, and theirs, and clearing the title of <hi>Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> and that with more resistance, and lesse concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then you shall have; therefore you shall do well at length to follow in that which is good, least they and their actions rise up against you.</p>

                  <p>The foresaid Author commenting, on Ezechiel, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth this to his time, and so may we to our times; for there are some of all sorts, but that the <hi>prudent</hi> in place of authoritie especiallie should <hi>keep silence,</hi> or not stand up in the <hi>gappe,</hi> that is the verie matter of the Lords <hi>wonder:</hi> for it is no wonder that the wicked in regard of their enmitie to God set their face against God, for in this they doe but their kinde; but for such as have taken Gods <hi>presse-mony,</hi> weare his <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> given up their names to fight his <hi>battailes,</hi> and have inrouled themselves for his houshold <hi>Servants;</hi> for such (we say) to have neither hand nor tongue, for Gods cause, and the removing of Gods enemies, it is a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>wonder</hi> indeed. In the originall, the Lord is said to <hi>cause himself to wonder,</hi> as if he could not wonder enough. He speaketh to our capacitie, and herein taxeth our <hi>stupiditie;</hi> shall all the hoste of Hell, as <hi>Atheists, Papists,</hi> loose <hi>Libertins, Time-servers, Neutrals, Carnall Gospellers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> band themselves to the desperate service of the Divell, whose end is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and shall not the servants of the most high, whose wages is life eternall, lay all at the Lords foote, for the deliverie of Sion: what a wonder is this?</p>
                  <p>This threateneth (as the Lord speaketh in that place of Ezechiell) a <hi>wafling of the vineyarde;</hi> yea further a particular judgment to such as are in authoritie, and stande not up in the gappe: <hi>I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gappe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8853:124"/> before me for the Land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.</hi> Observe what followeth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore have I powred out mine indignation upon them, I have consumed them <hi>with the fire of my wrath; their owne way have I recompenced upon their owne head, saith the Lord God.</hi> Where we intreate your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to observe Hieroms observation upon the place, who by the <hi>heads</hi> understandeth the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi> that howsoever the Lord will destroy that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where there is none to <hi>take his part against the wicked,</hi> yet he will plague the <hi>heads,</hi> especially who should stand up <hi>before the Lord in the Land,</hi> to save the rest.</p>
                  <p>If for further encouragement you would be further satisfyed, to what commandement the duty should be reduced, since everie act must be warranted by a Law; we answer to the 2. commandement, which as it condemneth all unlawfull <hi>governours,</hi> and <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> with all mens devises in Gods worship; so it enarmeth men of place (as Magistrates and Ministers) to abandon all counterfeit government, and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious worship. And so much for the first reason.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The 2. reason or motive added to inforce this duty upon you, is from the Kings gracious speech, at the last confirmation of the priviledges, in Parliament; wherein he did cast himselfe &amp; the care of the state up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; signifying, that if you had not a happie <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, you might blame your selves:</hi> now what happie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:8853:125"/> can be to King or state, except ye pluck up the plants of all our unhappinesse. As a word to the wise is enough, so a <hi>word</hi> from a <hi>willing King</hi> is enough. Your actions of reformation, by supplanting of <hi>mightie evills,</hi> shall be the best comment to the Kings <hi>speeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kings are not onely content, but also desirous to have divers things done, that they would hardly be seen in, till they be done, and then they are willing to owne them; the reason is: they love to try what <hi>stewards</hi> of <hi>State</hi> they have, and whether they answer their places, in daring to remove the <hi>Silver</hi> from the <hi>drosse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is worthie the observing, that the State of Silicia presented once a petition to Caesar, against one D. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnius; a lewd Favorite, and oppressing Deputie. <hi>Lucius Calphurnius, fur, latro, &amp; maechrus est: quid tibi videtur?</hi> Calphurnius is a theef, a robber, &amp; a hoore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger; what thinke you?

                  <p>With this principall the Netherlands Arminians were well enough acquainted, about twelve yeare ago, when they drew to an head: and after much deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by armes and tearmes, they plainly expressed themselves, that they desired no more, but that Lord Bishops should be erected, who might set all thing in order, and keep the Church in peace; To that end they had cast their thoughts upon <hi>Vtenbogard,</hi> to be the man, who with <hi>Barnevelt</hi> should have vassalled all to their owne will; so that they knew, that <hi>peace</hi> should have beene the <hi>warre</hi> of the Church: for the <hi>Arminian,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Antichristian</hi> Bishops, are as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne relatives, which mutuallie subsist;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8853:126"/> yea the <hi>veyns</hi> and arteries of the Prelacie, caried both <hi>blood</hi> &amp; <hi>spirits</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> and other parts, to the maintenance of the Belgick Arminianisme, the poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able root, whereof lay lower at that time then we yet well conceive; and had so spred itself over the Low Countries, and England especiallie; that we may say of the <hi>Papists</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians,</hi> as the Britans said of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and the <hi>Sea: Pellunt barbari ad Mare, repellit Mare ad barbaros:</hi> We are tossed betweene the <hi>Devill,</hi> and the <hi>deepe Sea of Rome.</hi> As it is ordinarilie now; no Papist, or blancher with Papist, no <hi>Statesman;</hi> so no <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi> no <hi>Bishop,</hi> or fatte parson.</p>
                  <p>As the Netherlanders then had best looke to it, that their monstruous Rebellions bring not back againe upon them those <hi>pragmaticall Fathers of Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi> to the losse of themselves, and what they have gained; so necessitie is laid upon you the <hi>valiant men of Israell,</hi> to set both the Fathers and the Children on packing; for if all our enemies, forrain and Domistick use thē as the only fittest <hi>Instruments,</hi> to undo us; if you remove not them, the State shall be required of your hands; and the practise of the wicked shall condemne you, but we hope better things of you.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The 4. and last motive is this, that if the Lord awaken not your hearts, &amp; strenghthē not your hands, to stand up before the <hi>Lord,</hi> in delivery of the <hi>Land;</hi> then it is both a cause, &amp; a signe, that the Land is given
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8853:127"/> for lost; witnesse, the fore-cited place of Ezechiell: <hi>I sought a man among them, that should stand up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I found none.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore have I powred out mine indignation upon them, and have consumed them with the fire of my wrath,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To this also the Prophet Ieremie beareth witnesse, where speaking of the vineyard of the Lord, <hi>they have laid it desolate or waste,</hi>

                  <p>To the same effect, the Lord speaketh in an other place by the same Prophet:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The bellowes are burnt, the lead is consumed of the fire, the founder melteth in vain;</hi> That is to say: All paines and cost were spent upon that people in vain: what was the reason? <hi>the wicked were not taken away,</hi> that was a manifest token, that the Lord had <hi>rejected them,</hi> for they were but <hi>reprobate silver.</hi> As this is cleare from the word; so <hi>Comineus,</hi> and other great Statesmen, giveth this for an unfallible token of ensuing ruine, when none standeth up to deliver a State from the inbred devouring enemies of it.</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:8853:127"/>
                  <p>But some among us besotted insecuritie; may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reply: you are very peremptorie, ye are no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; God is not so readie to destroy, as everie <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spure</hi> out of the pulpit, or every prognosticating <hi>Scribler</hi> would make him to be; and if destruction do come, it may be we shall never see it; or if it come in our time, we can shift for our selves, as well as others.</p>
                  <p>For answer, the more warning the Lord giveth from the mouthes of his <hi>Messengers,</hi> or from the pennes of his <hi>Clerks,</hi> the nigher hand is destruction: Further we desire those <hi>Shifters,</hi> to take notice what the Lord saith to them by the Prophet Amos:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Others will reply, God hath taken off some of our arch-enemies, and will not he in their destruction establish our preservation? Yea sure, as hath been said, if we had <hi>hearts</hi> to follow home the <hi>blow;</hi> but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as the Lord gave us such in <hi>wrath,</hi> so he may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take them away in <hi>wrath,</hi> &amp; give us worse in their stead.</p>
                  <p>If we make not verie good use of Gods execution, &amp; do for God, as he hath done for us; he may justly deal with us, as he dealt with Iudah,<note place="margin">

                  <p>For answer, we must looke so to the performance of the condition, that we may chalenge the promise: <hi>If thow wilt diligently hearken to the voyce of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give eare to his commandements, and keep all his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, then will I put none of those diseases upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I am the Lord that healeth thee, or thy Physitian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if they will not heare and obey, then he threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth most of all, to punish them: who ever scape they shall not escape; witnesse, his owne mouth, by the Prophet Amos:</p>

                  <p>To what a corrupt and corrupting habite of sinne was Ierusalem growen? like a poysonable welspring it was ever casting out deadlie waters; yea they were
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:8853:132"/> growen <hi>shamelesse in their abominations,</hi> and therefore the Lord threateneth to slay them V. 15. Yet for all this the Lord biddeth them: <hi>Stand in the wayes, and behould, and aske for the ould way, which is the good way, and walke therein, and ye shall finde rest for your sowles, V.</hi> 16. As if the Lord should say: Looke but upon my wayes; compare them with the wayes of sinne, that seeme so sweete unto you, and wherein your deceiving Prophets sooth you up; considder whether my wayes be not both more equall, &amp; more profitable then the wayes of sinne; for in them ye shall finde <hi>refreshing,</hi> that is both comfort and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, where in the wayes of sinne there is nothing but wo and sorrow. So that (as Zanchie observeth) he allureth, or inforceth them to reformation. <hi>Argumento ab utili:</hi> From an argument of commodity.</p>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:8853:133"/> will dwell among them.</hi> Innumerable places from Genesis to the Revelation, we might quote to this purpose; but the point is so pressed dayly from the pulpits, and you are so well acquainted with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we neede but to give a taste. If Ephesus <hi>will repent, and doe her first worke;</hi> and Sardis <hi>strengthen the things that are like to dye.</hi> Yea if our <hi>Laodicea</hi> will be <hi>zealous and amend,</hi> the Lord will take up the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie betwixt us and him; he will set his favour upon us; in stead of judgment we shall have mercie; in stead of Ignomine glorie; in stead of want, plentie; valour and magnanimitie; for faint-heartednesse: our Church shall be <hi>buetifull;</hi> our common-wealth <hi>floorishing,</hi> and if ye <hi>remove the drosse from the silver,</hi> we have the promise of a gloriously <hi>refined King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second sort of proofe is from the never-failing practise of Gods <hi>performance,</hi> with all such as doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: hath the Lord failed, or come short in any thing that he hath promised?</p>
                  <p>Did not the Israelites upon their mourning &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away their Idolls, (especially Ashteroth) finde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the yoke of the <hi>Philistims,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.</note> and that by a glorious and marvelous victory over them, from the Lords owne hand, without ordinary meanes? What was <hi>Ai</hi> before <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when the cursed thing was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved? What was Benjamin before Iuda, when by humiliation their <hi>speciall sinne</hi> was done away? In a word, can any give an instance, that ever Gods people

                  <p>The third sort of proof is taken from the reason, why it should be so; namely, from the nature of Gods promisses; which are <hi>all yea and Amen:</hi> from his end and intent in his threatening, which is not to <hi>destroy,</hi> but to reclaim: and lastly from his order of proceeding, namely he inviteth alwayes to return, before he overturneth. <hi>Return, return,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Why will ye die?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Vpon this same point of ensuing good, the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caines are at a deadly enmitie, and naturall <hi>Antipathie</hi> with the brood of <hi>Prelats.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For a closer of this point; be pleased to observe one instance from the present practise of the Hollanders. Since that nation is marked of all the world, to be the <hi>procreant</hi> &amp; <hi>conservant cause</hi> of all mixtures of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as that <hi>Aegyptian Nilus,</hi> is the mother of all sorts of monsters; it is matter of some wonder, why they are so farre from tolerating that ould <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> and new <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> that they suppresse it with all their main; executing some, banishing other some, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring meanes and lives, and all in opposition of it; yea if the <hi>Arminians</hi> meat in private, their house &amp; means are like to be ruined &amp; spoyled by the multitud, the people persewed to the danger of their lives, so as they love no thing so much as <hi>Pictures</hi> &amp; <hi>prunking;</hi> so they hate no thing so much as the <hi>Spainyard</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminianisme:</hi> but what is the cause of all this indignation against Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme? Is it because it is the <hi>Popes Benjamin;</hi> the neetest spun threed of <hi>Poperie,</hi> the last and greatest <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of the <hi>man of sinne,</hi> (for as the liker a <hi>Mounkie</hi> is to a <hi>man,</hi> the greater monster it is; so the liker <hi>impietie</hi> is to <hi>pietie</hi> the more <hi>monstrous</hi> it is?) Or is it because they love, &amp; longe to be ingrafted in that Antichristian
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8853:136"/> stem of the <hi>Prelacie?</hi> Or because it drayneth the verie life out of Religion; and changeth all Religion into a <hi>Protean form</hi> of Religion? Or lastly, because it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth from the verie <hi>essence,</hi> and <hi>attributes</hi> of God, exalting man against his maker? No; not for all these; yea directly for none of these; for then they would suppresse Poperie fullie; then would they not with <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Solyman,</hi> or blanched Atheists, make so much of that <hi>Machivilian</hi> principall; that <hi>a State may tolerate any Religion, so it be for its profit:</hi>

                     </note> the vertue of the commandement; the Office of the Magistrate; the dealing of Idolaters with their false worship, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me this truth: and lastly; it is against the true profit of the State.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if in conscience they obeyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in one particular, they would also in an other, especiallie of the same <hi>species,</hi> or kinde: But since none of all these be the verie moving cause of their thus plying of the Arminians; what is the cause? Answer; this is the very marrow of the matter; they feare their <hi>coppie</hi> hould; namely, lest the Arminian grow so strong, that he overtop the State, and get the staffe out of their hand, (as indeed he is like to doe,) lest like a <hi>Marmosett</hi> (which caries the face of a man, &amp; yet is a great enemie to the Mounkie) he should learn a trick beyond all their tricks; to overturne their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; or lest out of desire of reveng, for the supposed wrong done to their sect; like the Arabian Monster
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8853:137"/>
                     <hi>Caccus,</hi> they should sett all on fire with their breath, &amp; yet live themselves like the Salamander in the flame; but if they can keep them under from all place of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, both in Church and common wealth; both in armes and civill judicature, (though in some of these places the Arminian prevayleth;) and if they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thē to the indignation of the people; and keep his horns so short, that he can not push; then they thinke they shall <hi>prosper in what they put their hand to;</hi> so that it is clear, that libertie, prosperous successe, glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun, plentie, prevailing against the enemie, and the enlarging of their tents, maketh them looke well to the Arminians water, that this bird of <hi>divers colours</hi> grow not to big in her nest.</p>
                  <p>Then if we set apart Religion, (which God forbid,) yet let glorie, prosperitie, and good successe, at home; victorie over our enemies, abroad; the removall of all evill; the enjoying of all good, all attending upon the downefall of the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> prevaile with you, to the abandoning of the stinch of these <hi>Harpies,</hi> which have made our Israell <hi>like a bird of divers colours,</hi> (as the Lord speaketh,) that is in stead of the Lords <hi>liverie,</hi> she is all stuck full of the gaudie Feathers of <hi>superstition,</hi> which causeth the Lord to sett the <hi>beasts</hi> &amp; <hi>birds</hi> of all nations about her, to eat her up.

                  <p>To conclude; be pleased (right Honourable) to take a patern out of the Prelats owne practise, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this point.

Is it not because they meddle with the great <hi>Diana</hi> of their <hi>Lordly pomp?</hi> These would have the Prelates bring their callings to the tryall of the <hi>Sanctuarie:</hi> These would have thē lay away their <hi>Lording,</hi> &amp; do the worke of the Ministerie; yea to be content of the portion of the Ministerie: These would have them to put away their <hi>abominations</hi> from the Lords eyes; where with they breake the backs, and overburden the consciences of many thousands: These would have them to suffer Christ, whom they have kept so long at the doore, to come in, and reigne among us: But these are saucie fellows: These the <hi>Land can not bear:</hi> These must be smitten on the cheek, and put in the worst place of <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or banished the Land? and why good men? <hi>what hath the righteous done?</hi> A dangerous thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; they have spoken against the <hi>profit</hi> of the <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie;</hi> and as one of the ancients saith well:<note place="margin">Trithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>One of the <hi>Prelates watchmen,</hi> preaching before the King, out of the 11. of Numbers, upon Moyses pains taking, and the people his murmuring: In his <hi>Misapplication,</hi> came first to gird at the loan-mony recusant; and then bitterly to envey against the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> or <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> (as it pleased him to tearm them;) but why against them? because they could not endure that either due obedience, or Honourable maintenance, should be given to the Bishops; and therefore (said he) they had best looke to them; for if they have the cutting of the Bishops <hi>Cloath,</hi> their trayns will be short enough.</p>
                  <p>But to leave him in his Spiders <hi>Web,</hi> and to follow the point a litle further: Intruders upon other mens right, can endure any men (how bad so ever) rather to live by them, then the servants of him, whom they intrude upon; <q rend="margQuotes">and thence it is, that these wicked hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen killed the servants, (as it is in the Gospell,) that came to receive their Maisters rent, Mat. 21.33, &amp;c.

                  <p>Divers laterall or side-windes may blow together; but windes directly opposite, can not blow together: Herode &amp; Pilate did agree to the crucifying of Christ, because that winde might possibly blow some profit to them both, (as they supposed by the pleasuring of Caesar.)

                  <p>For first, how can the <hi>Scepter carryers of Antichrist</hi> affect and further a State, or Church governed by the

                  <p>Masculous resolution, and strenuous action, are the two twins of an Heroick Spirit: as armes are never wanting to maintaine true fortitude; so too, these two brought forth by true valour, and mature deliberation, meanes can not be wanting; If out of <hi>the pride and feare of the heart,</hi> they be not neglected, or <hi>quarrelled,</hi> the worke shall be done; but if all the meanes that possiblie could be thought on, were laid open to the eye of a state,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thrise noble Nehemiah undertooke a great work; had very weake meanes, much opposition: not onely by the enemies without, but even by that false bellie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god betraying priest Semaiah, he was tempted to a cowardly forsakeing of the work; but God gave him <hi>an other heart.

                  <p>It is a good admonition of Peter Martyr: <hi>in Ecclesia reformanda Elizei exemplum imitandum est;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">in <hi>2.</hi> Reg. v.</note>

                  <p>D. Downam would make the world beleeve that the contempt of these <hi>Bishops,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Epist. dedicat.</note>
                     <hi>is the cause of the greatest evill, if not of all the evill among us;</hi> for which he citeth Chrysostome in 2. Timoth. 2. But D. Downam doth know verie well, that Chrysostom knew no such Bishops as he speaketh off: indeed the contempt of Bishops, of Gods making, is no small cause of the evills that are upon us, and yet are further threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened against us; but all this contempt cometh, upon them by the Prelats Tyranizing over them; who can not, but by removal of the Prelacie attain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor due to them.

                  <p>To bind this precept the closser to our sowles, let us observe but the reasons of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Iealousie of God, that can endure no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition in the ordering of his howse, is threatened as a fire, to consume the breakers of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He houldeth them <hi>haters</hi> of him, that dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him any other service; or order in his howse, then himself hath appointed; and so they are indeed; for they that will appoint a Law to God, they can not endure him to be their Law-giver.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Iudgement against the breach of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement extendeth to the posteritie. This parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular much concerneth us; for we thinke that the whole nation (save a <hi>sillie few</hi>) have contented it self with the form of government, and worship prescribed in the Church; and they have lived; and dyed good Christians, with much confort; yea have not divers worthie men among us, after long standing out, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with peace enough, to imbrace and plead for the Ceremonies and government?</p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:8853:149"/>
                  <p>Well this same threatening of <hi>visiting the sinnes of the Fathers vpon the Children,</hi> will fright us out of the <hi>clift of this rock,</hi> if it be well thought on; for what know we, but we are the men with whom the Lord of the howse will reckon, visiting the Idolatrie, and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our predecessours upon us, especiallie we follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their steps: and put the case, we be taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of visitation come; yet first we know not what it may cost us in our consciences, ere we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, either for never manifesting such love, as we should, in keeping of this commandement; or for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our first love once had to this commandement. 2. We must know for a certain, if we reforme not that, our posteritie must pay for it; &amp; thus what great cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie do we joyne with impietie?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And lastly; Let that rich and abundant love of God, promised to the keepers of that commandement, constraine our hearts (if there be any love of Christ in us) to manifest our love to him, and our posteritie, by keeping of this commandement. We have been the larger in the discoverie of this mean of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. Because an evill must be knowne before it can be avoyded, or removed. 2. Because in the midst of much <hi>knowledge we are like to be led captive,</hi> (as the Prophet speaketh,) for want of knowledge of this particular.</p>

                  <p>THe second mean of removall of this great evill, is for Ministers and Magistrates, to set themselves against this superstitious worship, and Antichristian government; teaching, and exhorting others, for to doe the same: they must labour, and cause others la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a holy hatred of the Prelates, and their burthens, as they are enemies and enmitie to God; Of which that Godly King and Prophet gives a good president: <hi>I hate vain inventions, or imaginations,</hi>

                  <p>To lay open the fowle abusing and prophaning of this sacred ordinance, as by the Prelates sole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; the committing of the power to men uncapable; denouncing it against the good; Abusing of it to bables, and trifles; We have no time: Let this suffice that their practise in these, and other particulars, is against the word of God; the practise of the Apostles; all reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, from the beginning to this time; against Fathers, Councils, all Orthodox Authors, and in some things against their owne constitutions; witnesse, Constitut. Anno 1571. but to the point; whereas against all Laws this they do, where they have no authoritie; so the Churches of Christ by that power committed to them, may and should exercise this jurisdiction of Censure against them (if otherwise they will not be reclaimed from tyrannizing over Gods howse,) and that this is

                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:8853:152"/>
                  <p>To come to reasons: the first is from that principle of nature, wherewith everie Childe is acquainted. <hi>Omne totum majus est sua parte:</hi> The whole is greater then the part; yea, as it containeth everie part in it, so it hath power over every part. Now a Bishop (make the best of him) is but a part, or member of a Church; therefore he must be subject to the Censure of a Church: This Enthymem the Pope cannot evade, being pressed with it, by our writers from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Gregorie,<note place="margin">

                  <p>A second reason may be taken from that Sonn-ship that they professe to the Church: they are often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding others. <hi>Non habebit Deum Patrem,</hi> &amp;c. they have not God for their Father, that have not the Church for their Mother: They are beaten here with their owne rod; for they beate and spurn their Mother, and yet like ungratious Children they dispise their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers correction: If they be <hi>within,</hi> will they not be judged.</p>

                  <p>Other arguments we might use, as from the dignitie of the Church; from the end of the Churches Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; which is to <hi>pull men as brands out of the fire;</hi> and from the danger of such, as <hi>Kick</hi> against this prick; but we name them onely, since in every particular lyeth, the force of an argument: as for these that will be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly ignorant, let them be ignorant still: but one thing we intreat you to observe, and we desire the Hierarchie to take notice of it; that this exalting of themselves above the Church rellisheth strongly of the grossest Poperie; and with Popish Arguments they doe maintain it. The grosser Papist houldeth the <hi>Pope</hi> to be above the Church, as Iohannes Saracenus,<note place="margin">Pol. Paris. p. <hi>42.</hi>
                     </note> Bellarm. and Baronius; but the more moderate Papists teach the contrarie; witnesse, Thomas Corfellis, in his dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at the Counsell of Basill, cited by Aeneas Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius: <hi>Dicimus vniversae Ecclesiae potestatem omnimodam esse concessam; Romanum{que} pontificem illi subjectum; posse per ipsam deponi, abijci, excommunicari:</hi> We say that all power is given unto the Church; and that the Pope is thereunto subject; and by the Church he may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, rejected, and excommunicated. The same question was debated, and concluded affirmativelie; namelie, that the Pope is subject to a Councill; witnesse Gerson, cited by Saravia;<note place="margin">Cont. Ger. p. <hi>367</hi>
                     </note> will it not then follow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyablie, that a Prelate, or a pettie Pope, is subject to the Censure of a Church? both Hierarchie and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists grant the antecedent: <hi>Potestas Ecclesiae supra Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam:</hi> the power of the Church is above the Pope.</p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:8853:153"/>
                  <p>This doth D. Morton cite from Sylvius; and why hath not a Congregation,<note place="margin">Apot. p. <hi>2.</hi> lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> or Church, power over a Prelate?</p>
                  <p>Some would faine wrangle with the consequent thus; that there is not the same reason from the power of a Church universall over the Pope; and of a particular Church in controversie with a Bishop: one of their owne Bishops taketh away this instance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that our Saviours words:<note place="margin">D.

                  <p>The trueth of this consequent is also clear from reason, for by what power is a Councill superior, or doth exercise its power, but because it is a Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative? and from which ground, both Popish, &amp; Protestant writers, presse the Popes subjection to the Censure of it; In witnesse whereoff, D. Andrews ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Cardinall Cameracens. Cusan. and the whole <hi>Schoole of Sorbon;</hi> concluding it against the Pope, in the Councill of Constance: If that man of sinne then should be not onely deposed; but also cast out, if on formall proceeding, he would not repent him of his <hi>exalting himself against God;</hi> what letteth, but the <hi>limbes</hi>

If any object the Magistrates interposed authoritie; it is quicklie answered: <hi>quod ejus potestas non est privativa, sed cumulativa:</hi> that his power is not to abate, or weaken any ordinance of God; but rather for guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and making good all the ordinances of God, punishing with the sword the opposers.</p>

                  <p>One remarkable argument he useth: that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate himself being a member, and subject to the ordinance, cannot exempt any man from this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: For this he citeth the Churches practize upon Ozias, 2.

                  <p>D. Whittaker contriveth this argument into few words: <hi>Qui vincit vincentem te, is etiam vincet te:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Cont. q. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>180.</hi>
                     </note> If the Church bring him under, that is over thee; shall it not also bring thee under, meaning the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:8853:154"/>
                  <p>For a closer of the proofe of this point; we produce the judgement of that <hi>World of wit,</hi> in his <hi>halcyon dayes;</hi> who in a generall assembly, with much admiration disputed acutelie this point <hi>pro</hi> &amp; <hi>con:</hi> whether male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors in life or religion, against the first, or second Table, might be cast out, notwithstanding they were lyable to temporall punishment: <q rend="margQuotes">He concluded affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, that hereticks, blaspheamers, refactarie schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, bloodguiltie persons, and the like of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree soever they were, ought to be cast out, by the Church; For they might escape the Kings hands; but the hand of God they could not escape. His Lawes must stand, said he; and we must all obey, though the Lawes of man be often made of none effect.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, or to this effect, the King spake; yea we could make it appeare, that awfull shaking <hi>blade</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> was more terrible to those robellious spirits, both to God and man, than the power of many Kings.</p>
                  <p>By this it appeareth, who be the Schismaticks in this point. The Sorbonists in their Booke, called the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Policie, chargeth Bellarmine, and Baronius, to be Schismaticks; because against the Councill of Constance &amp; Basill, they maintaine the Pope to be above a Councill? We require judgement, whether D. Downam, and D. Bridges, with others of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, maintaining Prelates, to be above the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8853:154"/> deserve not the liverie of Schismaticks, that they would put upon others?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, we want not approved practize for this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: Instance, that Censure put deservedly (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self acknowledged) upon M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Adamson, Bishop of S. Andrews; for taking that Antichristian title upon him (for litle other fell to his shair but sinne and shame.)</p>
                  <p>The effects of excommunication, which the Apostle calleth a <hi>giving up to Sathan,</hi> were heavily and fearfully upon him; namelie, inward pangs, outward paines, and much penurie: No forraigne absolution could ease him, till the Church, who had imposed the Censure, upon his humble confession and supplication, released him.</p>
                  <p>The Godlie, and Learned of the Realme, relate this at large; we must give but a touch: onelie this we wish, that they had still so used the stafe in <hi>driving away the fowles;</hi> that their <hi>sacrifice</hi> still might have been of as sweete a smell as formerlie: but let them and us up and recover our ground; taking Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes advice in this verie particular: <hi>Non purpuram; non fasces, &amp;c.</hi> Feare not the scarlet hood; the myter, rochet, nor the crocier stafe; ye have greater power than these; He bindeth this on with good reasons: <hi>Si hominem timetis, &amp;c.</hi> If ye feare man; that verie man shall mock you; but if ye feare God, you shall be reverenced of men. Yea further, the neglect of

Mean of removall of this evill, is conceaved by some to be a Councill called; wherein the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Prelacie, their superioritie, their Offices, and substituted Officers, their leiturgie, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, may be thorowly examined, and judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie: But before we com to the particular applicatiō of this Medsin, it shall not be amisse, to give a taste of the <hi>praecognita,</hi> or generals of a Councill, for the better clearing of the particular.</p>
                  <p>The Papacie and Prelacie are at strong opposition now and then among themselves, about the necessity, authoritie, and calling of a Councill, yet both joyne in opposition against the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or Reformers, (as they call them;) and this may appeare in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>First, they charge the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> with disliking of <hi>Councills;</hi> and againe, they braulle, &amp; keep a wondering, if at any time they call for a Councill; How can these hang together? That they do both these, let the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie,</hi> and their Soldiers beare witnesse against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

Where if they answer, that the Prelates succeeded the Apostles (as some do) then they crosse their owne confession; that a Metrapolitan is a meer humane institution. But they know well enough, and are forced to confesse; that there was no Metrapolitan for the space of 300. yeares after Christ; and will they say there were no Councils? and if there were, they must be null in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for want of a Metrapolitan. <hi>Fideles per Afiam conveniebant ac nuper natas Doctrinas,</hi>

The same author witnesseth, that Constantine, comming to the Crowne, by a decree, restablished the libertie of calling Synodes, or Christian Societies together; which were formerlie suppressed, by the tyranny of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. So that ye see the frequencie of Synodes before any Metrapolitan. Yea a Synod was kept at Antioch, as D. Reynolds witnesseth against the minde of a Metrapolitan.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What say they to all Synods that have beene kept by Reformed Churches, since the time of reformation? Surely, they dare not say, they are no Synods.

                  <p>Take for instance (to go no further) that Provinciall Synod, houlden Anno 1603. the first yeare of King Iames; which was all that was houlden from A<seg rend="sup">o</seg>. 1597. which a Learned worthie calleth: <hi>Flagellum piorum, &amp; pandoram illam è cuius pixide, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But what is the reason, the Pope, or Metropolitan pettie Pope will beare such a sway in Councill, or they will have no Councill at all? D. Whittaker giveth Bellarmine the reason: <hi>Certum est reum nolle convocare Concilium, à quo judicetur:</hi> a Malefactor will never call an Assyze; except he may be judge himself. But as Iunius citeth Augustin; is it any reason, <hi>vt vnus judex sit, &amp; accusator?</hi> that one should be both judge and accuser? <hi>Imo vt quispiam de alio judicare vellet,</hi>

                  <p>It standeth not with the nature of true Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that these should haue any place in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; For a <hi>Ceremonie</hi> (as the Learned observe, as well Popish as Orthodox) is a <hi>sacred action,</hi>

                     <hi>Ceremoniae vero proprie, non nisi sacrae observationes in cultu divino appellantur:</hi> Politick government hath power, to appoint its owne rites, but Ceremonies properlie, are sacred observations in divine worship: Since so it is, what mortall man should dare to take upon him, to appoint Ceremonies, or sacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in Gods worship.</p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:8853:171"/>
                  <p>We wish from our sowles, that men would possesse themselves of that difference betweene <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> &amp; civill <hi>circumstances</hi> of order; the want of which obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation breadeth much disorder.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Civill circumstances in Gods worship have their ground from nature; as there must be a <hi>place</hi> to teach in, a <hi>cup</hi> for the communion; and so of the like; but so have not Ceremonies, but from God his owne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These circumstances of order and Comlinesse may be used in <hi>civill,</hi> as well as in <hi>sacred</hi> things; but so may not <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> witnesse, the Prelates coursing of a Minister, for wipeing his nose on the <hi>surplice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A second Position, crossed by the Ceremonies, is this: <hi>That all necessarie Ceremonies, under the Gospell; are contayned in the new Testament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first argument for proofe of this Position may be taken from the nature of a <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> discovered in the first Position to be a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>faith;</hi> Ergo, it must be contayned in the Gospell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may prove it by induction.</p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:8853:171"/>
                  <p>As Christ instituted the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> so the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Sacraments;</hi> as <hi>breaking of bread, distribution</hi> of it; and of the cup (though now removed by that Idolatrous gesture of <hi>kneeling:) Et sic de caeteris;</hi> and so of the rest.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, &amp;c. If this induction be not good, give us an instance against it, <hi>extra propositum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the truth of this Position, Chemnicius speaketh expresly: <hi>Quos ritus Christus addi voluit eosdem insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit:</hi> What <hi>Ceremonies</hi> Christ would have in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, he appointed the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may prove it also a comparatis, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the <hi>Gospell</hi> with the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All necessarie Ceremonies under the Law, were contayned in the Law, Exod. 24, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, all necessarie Ceremonies under the Gospell are contayned in the Gospell; otherwise the Law should be more perfect then the Gospel, which none will affirme.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And lastly; we use this argument a distinctis. Either the Gospell must contayne all necessarie Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods worship; or Christ hath left to the Churches power, to appoint Ceremonies: But Christ hath left no power to the Churches, to appoint Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Ergo, the Gospell contaynes all necessarie Ceremonies in Gods worship. The proofe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is thus: All that Christ hath left to the Churches appointment, is to order things by Christ himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, 1. Cor. 14.40.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:8853:172"/>
                  <p>But to appoint new Ceremonies, is not to order things by Christ himself appointed.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, he left it not to the Churches appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>For the last particular, that these Ceremonies stand in opposition to the Lawes; it is cleare, as we have shewed from that Leiturgie of Edw. VI. to the which the Law requireth subscription, and the booke leaveth the things arbitrarie.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath been said, it may appeare to your Honours, how the Prelates, and their apurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, shall never be able to stand in a <hi>Councill,</hi> which being guided by the word, cannot brooke that which is enmitie to Christ, and the State.</p>
                  <p>In these things we have beene the larger; that all may see how they invade, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Calvine sayth, the <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> bereaving his servants of the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How their <hi>tyrannie</hi> (as the same Author saith) exceedeth the Lawes of other tyrans; because they tyrannize over the <hi>conscience.</hi>

To show how by these courses of their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they do not onely <hi>transgresse the commandements of God,</hi> Math. 15.3. but they <hi>make voyd</hi> (as the Spirit speaketh) <hi>the worship of God, by the commandements of men;</hi> namely, in regard of the power of it; and the honour due to it, V. 9.</p>
                  <p>Let the Prelates disesteeme of Gods ordinance witnesse this; not onely in preferring the least, and vilest patch of their <hi>Leiturgie,</hi> to <hi>preaching</hi> (as their Canons witnesse;) but also by their phrase of speech in their Canons; where they scarse, or do not at all esteeme <hi>preaching</hi> to be a part of <hi>divine worship;</hi> witnesse the 19.

Yea, they musle up the <hi>mouthes of the oxen,</hi> and ty up the tongues of the faithfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:8853:177"/> both from treading out the corne, and eating of the corne.</p>
                  <p>Is it fitte, or possible, that one man should rule over so many places, so many miles distant from his person; as though he were a Metaphisicall entitie, or of such an infinite being, that he had <hi>spirit enough</hi> for them all: But what man is sufficient for one flock?</p>
                  <p>For a speedie redresse then of those evills, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat your Honours, to remove this fewell, and the fire shall cease; take away the <hi>Carion,</hi> and the <hi>Kites</hi> will be gone.</p>
                  <p>We need not tell you againe, what neede the State hath of these Meanes; and how well they might be imployed; onely this, we are bould to commend unto you, that as our nation (to our shame) is growen the Ape, and Monster of all strange fashions; So if you will bring the Prelates in such a cutt, that their cloaths may sitte closse to their bodyes; It will be the onely best fashion, that ever came into the Land. Yea so that sinne of strange fashions should fall with others.</p>

                  <head>The 6. Mean.</head>
                  <p>THe 6. and last Mean of removall, is the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a Parliament, till the tenets of the Hierarchie be tryed, by <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Countrie;</hi> that is, by the Lawes of God, and the Land.</p>
                  <p>The Kings royall word; the confirmation of the Lawes, and giving of subsidies, imply a necessity of redresse of grievances; which cannot stand with the dissolving of a Parliament, till reformation be effected; but if the common adversaries should inforce a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, because all reformation (if they be well sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) intrencheth upon them; Can it stand with the wisdome, valour, and fidelitie, of you, the <hi>great Maisters</hi> of State, to quite the ship, upon the tempestuous hard-blowing of a Babilonish <hi>Euroclydon?</hi> No sure; for as Paule said to the Centurion, and the Souldiers, <hi>Except ye abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 27.32.</note> So except ye keep the <hi>ship,</hi> till ye have beaten the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> of State; neither <hi>King, you</hi> nor <hi>we</hi> can be saved.</p>
                  <p>Your Honours know, that everie dissolution of a Parliament, without reall reformation, is against <hi>right, reason,</hi> &amp; <hi>record.</hi> Is it not the right of the State, to be disburdened of <hi>Caterpillers, moathes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Canker-wormes;</hi> and of such <hi>Lions,</hi> &amp; <hi>Beares,</hi> as devour <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp; <hi>State-Policie?</hi> What reason is it, that the State assembled from all the parts of the Kingdome, should waste <hi>time</hi>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:8853:178"/> and <hi>meanes;</hi> and when they pitch upon the point, they should be blowen up with the Romish breath of the enimie? so that, as Ioab said to David, concerning Absolon: <hi>Let them live, and if we all die, it matters not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly; for Recorde, there is an ancient one, the sight whereof your Honours may command, though we cannot. The Tenour whereoff is this, that this Court should continue sitting so long, as there were any matters belonging to this high Court to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and for the more exact effecting of this; it was openlie published by proclamation; some conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time before their rising; that the subjects should appeare, if they had any more matter of grievance, determinable in that Court.</p>
                  <p>This was confirmed (as we are informed) by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, notwithstanding that he came to the Crowne by the sword. Then stand your ground, and <hi>quite your selves like men</hi> in this matter of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; wherein (as we have shewed) you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at the head, or ye cannot prosper.</p>
                  <p>As we may say with <hi>David,</hi> there is but a litle <hi>between our life &amp; death;</hi> so it shall become you with the same Prophet <hi>to make haste,</hi>

                     <hi>and not to delay the keeping of Gods Commandement in this particular.</hi> As the same Prophet vowed that he would not come <hi>into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of his howse; nor go vp to his bed;</hi> that is, he would give himself no rest, or take no other thing to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:8853:178"/> his thought; <hi>till he had found out a place for the Lord;</hi> So should ye not take any privacie, so much to your thoughts, at home, or abroad, in your bed, or in the fieldes, as the making way for the <hi>Lords dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs;</hi> which cannot be done but by the removall of his enimies.</p>
                  <p>We have made bould to be the larger, because the matter is weightie, &amp; we desired to prove as punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as we could.</p>
                  <p>We might have beene larger, if the time and State would have permitted. But we know your Honours are perswaded of these things: (or as Paule said to Agrippa: <hi>we know you beleeve.</hi>) The pondering and maintenance whereof we humblie intreat at your hands. We doe acknowledge that it is an inveterate evill, and by custome and continuance hath much prevailed, as tyrannous Lawes use to doe Yea like the Idoll of <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Rumball,</hi>

                     </note> with their ginnes &amp; pinnes they have made it so heavie, that mē thinke it not poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, with all the strength of the State.

It is most true, <hi>ardua prima via est, &amp;c.</hi> the entrance will be somewhat hard, but the <hi>beginning is more then half.</hi> The way is verie steepe: but the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8853:179"/> glorie of the action, is of force enough to effect it. Remember that gracious, and incourageing speech of God, concerning Zerubabels finishing of that great work:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7.</note>
                     <hi>who art thou, O! great mountaine, before Zerubabell; thou shalt become a plaine, and he shall bring forth the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone thereof, with shouting and crying, grace, grace, vnto it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> 5.</note>
                     <hi>If your hands beginne it</hi> (as it followeth there) <hi>your hands shall finish it; And they shall know, that the Lord of Hoasts hath sent you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what need all those arguments, let this one plead for all: <hi>aut hoc, aut nihil:</hi> either this, or nothing.</p>
                  <p>The neglect of this one thing together with that main mean of true humiliation, maketh us more and more adoe; for as it weakeneth us, and strengtheneth the enemie; so it enarmeth the Lord in zeal daylie, to give us more and more matter of humiliation; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, his heavie hand in sinking that hopefull plant, the Prince of Bohemia, just at that time when this worke was a finishing. As all the enemies of Sion will rejoyce at it; so it is more matter of mourning to us, than we are aware off; yea (it may be) we may mourne more for it many yeares hence. Alase! why was he smitten but for our sinnes? which blasteth in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bud all the hopes of Sions deliverance. The Lord smite the hearts of his Princelie parents; our Royall Soveraigne; of you, the State representative, and the hearts of us all, to lay it to heart, as we should; for if we make not a right use of it, he hath a heavier rod for all and everie one of us; he will never leave smiting, till we smite that which smiteth at his Honour; If we love
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8853:179"/> sinne better then our first born, he will not only smite <hi>our first born,</hi> (that is our darling, whatsoever it be,) but he will at length consume us.</p>
                  <p>With heavie hearts, and mournfull eyes, we speake it; The like ominous thing hath not befallen our King and State, since the much like lamentable casting away of the two Sonnes, and one Daughter, of Henry the first; whose ship, by the carelesnes of the shipper, was splitt upon a rock; where of 150 persons, one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was saved, by laying hould on the mast, and was brought to Land the next day after.</p>
                  <p>This losse proved after, the ground of great trouble, to the State; of the demolishing of many faire howses, and noble families, and of the effusion of rivers of blood.</p>
                  <p>The Popes (or Prelates) Penmen, would make the Kings harshnesse to the Clergie, a speciall cause of this; but our Histories witnesse, that he suffered more of the Hierarchie, than was fitting for a King; witnesse that monstrous proud affront offered him by that tottering Prelate, Rudolph of Canterburie, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the Kings mariage, with the Duke of Lorains Daughter, because another than he was to joyne them. Yea, further at Barkley, at the Queenes coronation, he malapertly asked the King, who sett the Crowne upon his head; The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: he remembred not well; neither was it materiall. The Prelate (in a great rage) tould
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8853:180"/> him, that whosoever did it, he had done more then could be justified; and therefore (said he) to the King: <hi>You shall either leave off the Crowne, or I shall leave off saying of Masse.</hi> The King, without change of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, said no more, but if I have it not by right, doe with it as you please; whereupon he stept toward the King, &amp; began to unty the button, to take the Crowne off the Kings head; but the Nobilitie, and others waxing wrath,<note place="margin">Antiquit. at Britannic. p. <hi>124.</hi>
                     </note> at the impudencie of that saucie shave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, caused him, by crying out on him, to leave off his attempt with shame enough.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a wonder, that Kings &amp; Queens should either affect, or endure such a viperous generation? Some would make us beleeve, that the King (being struck with some panick terrors) repented his rough usage of that surly crew; but we are of that minde, that Kings, Queenes, &amp; others, have greater cause to repent that they either maintaine them, or have any thing to doe with them at all. For so long as they are the unhappie husbandmen of the vineyard, there is not a slip of any good like to grow in it; but either they spoyle it, or the Lord plucketh it up, that it may not be spoyled; witnesse (besides other instances) the present dolefull instance of our loosing the rarest Iewell of his age. As we all desire in the band of duetie, and the bowels of compassion, to condole in soule, with that mournfull King and Queene; so let us all desire the Lord, to put it into their &amp; our hearts, to joyne reformation with humiliation; and that in particular they may hate this Hierarchie, and their infectious Leiturgie, with a perfect hatred, for they shall never prosper by corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondencie with them.</p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:8853:180"/>
                  <p>As for the Kings admirable deliverance, we may say, though the <hi>one hand of the Lord was over him, yet the other was vnder him:</hi> And we wish his song may be of mercie, and of judgment; and that he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime to all the world, by amendment, that his greatest losse hath proved his greatest gaine.</p>
                  <p>To make an end of our present Subject. We wish your Honours might prevaile with the Prelates by faire meanes, to cast off that overcharging calling. If they would goe by president that is not wanting: <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> rejected this calling to stay conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

But to answer more directlie, let them take Hierax, for a president, without exception. Who forsooke the Prelacie (as Isidore witnesseth) meerelie for the <hi>vnlawfullnes of the calling.</hi>
